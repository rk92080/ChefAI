{"text":"<s> [INST] How can I purposely get clumps in my spaghetti [/INST] I find that I unintentionally produce this effect when I overcrowd the pasta in a pan and forget to agitate it while it is cooking. As the pasta softens it becomes sticky and holds to the neighboring pieces of pasta. Let it go like this long enough and it becomes irreversible, as the pasta fuses into clumps. Also, I am not sure that you want to risk it with the amount of pasta that you have at the moment, but another way to produce a variation on this is to par cook the pasta, cool it down, and then mix in some eggs and Parmesan for a spaghetti bake. When you bake this for a while - on a 9x13 baking dish, for example -  the pasta becomes clumped together thanks to the binding affect of egg. Maybe something to try on down the line."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Does bay leaf really make a difference? [/INST] If you want to get an idea of the flavour of bay leaves, warm up some milk to boiling point with a couple of dried leaves, switch off the heat and let it infuse for 15 minutes. It isn't mild by any means (though nor is it strident like rosemary or oregano) - but it is easy to overlook in a complex dish because it has a sort of alto/tenor \"inner voice\" quality which doesn't draw attention to itself.\n\nYou can use the milk mixture to make any white sauce, especially with fish (eg a British fish pie). It also makes outstanding egg custard, better than vanilla IMO in a sort of medieval-hipster way. Another excellent recipe is Marcella Hazan's [pork stewed with porcini and juniper](https://rhubarbfool.co.uk/tag/marcella-hazan/) (I wouldn't bother to crumble them). There is a lot going on there but the bay is an important part to my taste.\n\nI find the taste of fresh bay leaves unpleasant and always used dried.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why are so many Americans obsessed with “kosher salt”? [/INST] Kosher salt has larger crystals than table salt, making it easier to grab and season food with, making it less dense (and thus easier to add by hand without small volume differences making a large salinity difference) and (for some varieties, namely Diamond brand kosher salt) giving it a much nicer texture when it hasn't dissolved into the food. This means professional chefs and most cookbook writers use kosher salt for everything and thus they will typically specify \"kosher salt\" in the ingredients, otherwise the same amount of table salt will make the food very salty. Kosher salt is also not iodized, and some people dislike the taste of iodized salt, especially chefs, who often care a lot about how food tastes.\n\nAs for what's up outside of America, I can't really say."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] What are the differences in ingredients / restaurant food supply sources between low end, middle range, and high end dining establishments? [/INST] I have been in restaurant food supplies for 18 years and worked for 6 different suppliers. I don't think I even know where to begin with debunking all the misinformation in this thread already. \n\nThis is a much more huge and complex question than most people realize. Even the high end dining establishments with two very similar menus can have two completely different sourcing strategies. There are some kitchens that do so many things completely from scratch but I think people would be surprised to find out how many items come premade in high end kitchens as well. Take for example something as completely simple as French Fries. I can walk into a kitchen that serves $40-$50 entrees and find a box of frozen Lamb Weston french fries that are hand cut with skin on and been properly washed, blanched and frozen. I can also walk into a low end kitchen and find a Lamb Weston box of french fries but those are scraps from cuts that have just been frozen. Same manufacturer, same plant, same machine, it just a different french fry that gets boxed. Fewer than 5% of restaurants cut their own french fries and given the quality of the more expensive frozen fries, there isn't always a reason to. You would be surprised at how far food science has come and what items are coming from premade and frozen. There are different tiers of frozen though. You will find a freezer in every higher end restaurant. Fewer than 1% of restaurants use no frozen items. \n\nI see a lot of misinformation on produce supply as well. The small independent produce supplier has the same box of Mann's lettuce as the big boys. Farms want to most stable supplier to offer them contracts on their supply. So often times the first pick of the fields go to the big guys. In fact US Foods and SYSCO both have employees that go to farms and pick what fields they want their supply to come from. Plus they have their own distribution so often the produce makes it onto a truck within 48 hours of being harvested. The small guys have to wait for the rest of the fields to be shipped to terminal markets and buy from whole sale suppliers there often meaning they hold product longer. Also smaller suppliers do not have food safety measures in place. The reason to go with a produce specific company for higher end restaurants is that they offer more specialty items, can make up for poor quality by doing 2nd runs same day and offer more delivery days. All of this could relate to meat as well. \n\nFrozen gets a bad rap but often times chefs prefer some things frozen. Take green peas for example. They can be frozen at peak of freshness whereas most fresh that comes in is hard to keep from getting too soft, so most chefs buy frozen even in scratch kitchens. Bread can very well be another example. Bread can be frozen at peak freshness and thawed and resume at near the same state. A lot of bakery suppliers offer shelf stable bread that is several days old. I have worked for a bakery that does fresh daily bread but how many restaurants get daily deliveries? We may have baked fresh every day but if we deliver a load and it's 3 days until the next delivery you are eating 3-4 day old bread at your higher end restaurant. \n\nJust throwing out another random example is Hollandaise sauce. Medium to higher end restaurants that do brunch don't always find a benefit of doing their own hollandaise. You'd be surprised at how many buy it in jugs. However, that really expensive shelf stable hollandaise is not the same hollandaise the small diner is buying. Yes you can tell the small diner doesn't make their own hollandaise because it's chalky and not rich. The higher end if very hard to tell.\n\nA common cutting tactic among food distributers is have chefs blind taste test high end pre made products vs their own and it's always surprising how many they cannot find a quality difference. The main point is there are different tiers of premade and quality food. People have a perception of how medium to high end restaurants source and I think you'd be very surprised to go look at the back of house boxes.\n\nLast note is when I'm talking about higher end restaurants I am talking of restaurants with $30-$50 entrees and not Michelin star places. Those are a different beast. Like I said in the beginning there are differences among EVERY restaurant. I can walk you into a place with less than $10 entrees that is all made from scratch and I can walk you into a $30 entrée place that is majority premade higher end products.\n\nOk really last note now. COVID caused a lot of restaurants to throw out large amounts of inventory and lay off staff so many have no one to prep products now so even more than before is sourcing higher end quality premade and frozen products.\n\nEDIT: thinking about it, we often discuss with chefs what truly counts as \"from scratch\". Less than 100 years ago every chef and even home cook knew how to make cheese. How many restaurants make their own cheese now. I don't know of a single one. If you had a chef from 100 years ago walk into a kitchen today and see chefs using a prepacked cheese, even if it's higher end, they would scoff that they aren't really making their own. However, if a chef adds it to a dish today and the rest is made themselves, they are considered to still have done it from scratch. \n\nTake milled flour as well. There used to be so many local mills because flour used to go bad quickly! So you had to have it milled close to homes. Flour today has additives in it to make it shelf stable. Virtually every kitchen in the world uses this shelf stable flour with additives and no one bats an eye. Pastry and cakes and anything else made with it is still from scratch but yet if we got a piece of meat or sauce with additives in there we would scoff. \n\nThe point is the industry has continually moved towards products that a short time ago would be considered not fresh or from scratch. The industry is continually moving there and some restaurants are more ahead of the curve than others. I think some of the things we scoff at restaurants for not doing themselves right now will be common place before the end of most of our lives."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] I just moved into an apartment that used to be a restaurant. So I have my own personal restaurant-grade wok stove. Got any tips? [/INST] Here's things in random order as I think of them.   \n\nFirst off, you're gonna burn things. A lot of things. It's a learning experience.  Don't let anyone tell you to turn down the heat.  I mean... turn down the heat for some things, but other things where you need the firepower, learn to use the heat rather than tame it.  \n\nThe absolute most important thing to know (outside of the fire extinguisher) is mise en place.  You have literal seconds before things start burning so you don't have time to stop and get something when the train starts rolling.    \n\nEquipment wise, you'll need a ladle (which you already have), a wok spatula, a metal strainer that fits over a pot with the pot, and a bamboo brush. First two are obvious. You'll use one or both tools to manipulate the food.  The metal strainer (google wok strainer, it'll look kinda like a wok but with holes) is to filter food cooked in oil.  The pot holds the oil.  Something without handles is best. Measure your work area to find one that fits the front part.  This is where you effectively oil blanch foods. Use this oil to cook with as well.  \n\nThe bamboo brush is how you clean the wok.  After you're done cooking a dish, use the ladle and ladle some water out of the water \"can\".  \"Wash\" (more like rinse) and use the brush to get any food particles.  The wok burner itself should have a drain and a basket to collect food particles.   If it doesn't, dump it in the sink with a strainer.  \nSome of the fancier wok setups have a 2nd burner for a pot of water. This is meant to be used for blanching and as a source of water.  Since you don't have this, keep a metal \"pot\" of water around. You don't want to fiddle with the tap during cooking.  \nMeasure the back part to fit it there.   \n\nUse your knee to adjust the flames.  Things getting out of control or you have to add a few things? Turn it down a little.  Yeah I broke my own rule. It was more meant for \"cook on low\".   \n\nEveryone and their dog says use day old rice for fried rice. This is only true if you don't have a wok burner.  You're one of the few lucky ones that can use fresh rice.  Cook some off 1:1 water:rice.  It's a low ratio.  Spread it out on a plate to cool when cooked.  \nHere's where you prep things like eggs/chicken/bbq pork/shrimp/etc.  \n\nWhen you're ready to cook, oil the rice and set aside.  Oil the wok, add the eggs, and scramble.  Set those aside. Highest heat you can get and oil the wok again (fairly heavily) and dump in the rice.  Break it up as much as you can with the spatula. Basically \"chop\" it.  Toss the rice and continue breaking it up using the back of the ladle in a beating motion. Continue this toss and and beat until your rice toasts. Add in your cooked chicken/pork/shrimp/whatever. Add your eggs, a handful of peas, and bean sprouts. Toss again to incorporate.  Add salt.  Taste.  Adjust with more salt.  Toss once more and plate.  The perfect actually fried rice.  \n\nFor something like mixed veg, you want to blanch the veg.  Heat the wok, add in some garlic, then the blanched veg.  Add a seasoning sauce (we had a \"generic\" one with white pepper, chicken powder, salt, and a few other things) but you can use anything you want.   Add in some water and mix in a corn starch slurry.  Heat til thick and plate.  Most of the cooking is done via blanch.   \n\nChow mein (and veggies), blanch the noodles and drain.  Heat up, oil in, noodles in, water in, soy sauce in.  The water helps distribute the soy evenly.  Cook off the water and you're effectively done.  We used our \"generic\" seasoning but again, use anything you want.  \n\nAny other dishes you're curious about or if you need more than basically a bullet point that I gave above, feel free to ask."}

I'll be reaching out to them, but I don't know how long will it take for me to receive a reply.\n\n...\n\nAlright, here’s the answer. I’m sorry for the delay.\n\n\nSince my contact is a chemist and not an anthropologist, I’m afraid neither him nor I will be of much assistance in that department. I apologize in that regard. However, some of the answers in the thread like u/justanothercook ‘s and u/shreddedlikechedda ‘s provided a more cultural approach, which covers the topic of “blooming” and “tempering” better than I could.  Aside of that, we discussed, with the assistance of OP, the variables that affected the result in this culinary process. We’ve also been making some assumptions (e. g.: temperature is ideally T<180ºC or 180ºC<T<200ºC. We considered refined olive oil since the smoke point is above 200ºC. We also assumed the optimal storage conditions for all the ingredients). This is the conclusion:\n\n\n“[…] The question is complex and can only be answered in general terms. It will obviously depend on:\n\n\n\n1)       Whether the spice is whole or grounded, and the size of the grounded spice\n\n\n2)       Temperature of the oil\n\n\n3)       Quantity of oil used\n\n\nAROMATIC EXTRACTION: As you’ve said, the oil acts as a dissolvent and extracts liposoluble compounds with less effort. The quantity of oil and spice used will impact in the concentration of aromatics extracted in the oil. Aside of that, heat can affect the extraction, but in this case depends on the volatility of the aromatic compounds, since too high a heat will cause some of these compounds to disappear. Some aromatic compounds are not as volatile as others when heated, which comes to say that when you apply high temperatures, the oil is richer in these more stable compounds, resulting in a different flavor.\n\n\nAROMATIC ALTERATION: Regarding chemical reactions, there are multiple taking place, since there’s a huge amount of aromatic compounds and these vary depending on the spice you’re using, but in your case most of these are related to the size of the grounded spice (more contact with oxygen) and the temperature of the oil. A higher heat and a finer grain will mean a more noticeable alteration of these compounds. Also, the grinding size will affect from the moment of the grinding, so using a freshly grated spice will be different from using an already-ground version.”\n\n\nTo my understanding, Indian cooks often use a lot of oil, high temperatures and whole spices, while these variables (the ones listed in the quote above) differ in the Western version, hence the different result. I think a fun exercise to do at home would be to play with all that, if you’re up to the challenge. If anyone does, it would be cool to have their observations. I don’t think much else can be said with certainty without entering too hard into the food chemistry field.\n\n\nI’ve been translating from my native tongue to English and back, so I’m sorry if something seems out of place. I also made a very ugly drawing to illustrate all the possible outcomes we discussed (I can't seem to share it in this subreddit, so ask me and I'll DM it to you). This one is not translated but can be understood.\n\n \n\nI hope the answer can somewhat sate your curiosity. Thank you for the interesting question, and all the people that helped find an answer. Have a good day."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Chefs, is it rude to ask for steak well done? [/INST] Professional line cook here. Cooks are generally not _insulted_ when someone orders a well-done steak. It does not constitute a judgement on the quality of our product or the qualifications of our team. There are some modifications/requests that _do_ frequently offend the sensibilities of the cook staff, but a well-done temp isn't among them.\n\nAn order for a well-done is still upsetting though, for several reasons. A well-done generally takes longer to cook than _anything else_ on the menu, which can drag an order and disrupt the flow of service. Also, good cooks generally like to make good food, and they generally think of a well-done as being bad food. It's dispiriting to take good product (steaks are often the most expensive line item on the food budget, per portion) and be ordered \"ruin\" it. To many cooks it seems irrational or ignorant to order the most expensive thing on the menu, only to have it rendered tough and tasteless. Cooks have an ongoing low-level simmer of contempt for all customers, but being forced to enable their poor judgement in such a way can cause that disdain to boil over.\n\nSo while ordering a steak well-done _does upset_ the cooks, it's not exactly _rude_. The cooks are a haughty and judgemental lot, and in their view someone who orders a well-done is perceived as lacking in refinement, knowledge, and/or personal strength of character."}
{"text":"<s> [INST] Are there different cuts of meat in different cultures or does everyone basically butcher the same way? [/INST] Yes, different cultures have different cuts of meat, however they mostly all follow the same patterns because the musculoskeletal structure of the animals doesn't change. A good example of this would be the differences in American (US) style butchery and Spanish butchery. The primal cuts are pretty much the same with some debate as to where the major cuts should be made however the sub primal get broken down very differently. Two major factors that affect the subprimal cuts are intended use and cutting equipment. In more industrialized societies you see more of what would be called square cutting, where a butcher breaks the primal down into more uniform cuts based on where it is easiest to cut through the bones with a band saw. In countries with a longer tradition of butchery/charcuterie you see more of what would be called seam butchery where primals are broken down into muscle groups and individual muscles with as little use of a band saw as possible. There are also regional differences in the names given to certain cuts which can lead to confusion as well."}

[/INST] Hi I am a Thai chef and can probably answer this question decently. In your run of the mill restaurant it is likely just how much dried pepper they use which is a damn shame. I eat hot food but some places will ruin a dish by just making it dry with the amount of pepper flakes they put on it. Truthfully, you can almost always order a 3 or 2 and it will be fine. Not disgustingly unbalanced but also not missing the heat. Now for the more detailed answer. \n\nIn thai food they don't use chili oil very often. It exists as a product of China but they don't use it nearly at all. Some regional foods are hotter than others and it can determine which type of chili is used. Some use dried, some use less spicy but fresh peppers. Eastern Thai (also called Issan Thai) is the hottest regional cuisine but northern Thai is genrally not that spicy by comparison. I don't believe in artificially scaling heat.  Thai food is all about balance of flavor with heat being a key component. Not all thai food it naturally hot. Some is disturbingly spicy.

{"text":"<s> [INST] The trend in toxic kitchen environments [/INST] It’s perpetuated by hothead chefs and the fraternity idea that everyone has to undergo hazing. Fortunately there are significant improvements I’ve seen in the last couple decades since I started cooking professionally. In my own kitchen, we do not allow yelling, swearing, or publicly dressing-down other cooks. If someone makes a mistake you wait until after service and take them aside to talk about it.\n\nIt does mean in some ways things are less efficient as prep cooks don’t have that fire under their ass to produce faster or get screamed at. But we more than make up for that in extremely low turnaround. Our cooks start with us and stay with is so we have great institutional knowledge which saves us a ton of effort in hiring and training. End of the day it works better for morale, morality, and the bottom line.\n\nI also think Gordon Ramsay in particular has a lot of blame on his shoulders for this. He saw the ratings that the shouty chef personality got him on TV and just went with it. The result is generations of cooks who think it’s acceptable to behave like an asshole to coworkers, and highly toxic, macho kitchens that make work unfairly difficult, especially for women and minorities.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I wasn't clear. I didn't mean to imply that Ramsay started this. The abusive kitchen has existed for a LONG time (read Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, or Jacques Pepin's memoirs, E.G.), just that in the age of the celebrity chef, Ramsay became the poster child for the idea that you need to abuse your staff in order to get good results, and consequently, many young cooks these days think it's OK to behave that way because a guy like Gordon Ramsay has given them his blessing. He didn't create abusive chef culture, but he has historically gone out of his way to use his incredibly huge influence to perpetuate it, and it makes me sad to think of the number of young cooks who have had to face abusive, toxic work environments due to Ramsay's wide-reaching influence."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Is there such thing as ‘cooking theory’, i.e. an abstract set of principles that explains what makes a good dish? [/INST] Yes, most definitely.\n\nA really minimalist but effective basis is the famous Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat cookbook and show from one of the chefs that came up in Alice Water's fine restaurant. More comprehensive books would be The Food Lab, How to Cook Everything, and On Food and Cooking.\n\nHere's my own personal theoretical framework, as a moderately skillful home cook that has cooked things that occasionally get praise like \"I dreamed about that dish for several nights\". It's just a hodge podge of what I've picked up, predominantly focused on learning from people like Kenji Alt-Lopez, Harold McGee, Herve This and similar.\n\nTaste is on your tongue. Flavor is in your nose. Your brain combines these into a unified sensation, where texture and appearance matter substantially as well.\n\nTaste is: salty, sour, sweet, bitter, umami.\n\nFlavor is countless volatile organic compounds.\n\nTo some extent tastes balance each other. Increasing saltiness and sourness at the same time doesn't taste overly sour or overly salty, just more intensely delicious. Good recipes know what they're trying to target on the 5 tastes and use ingredients in a way that allows you to amplify and balance.\n\nFlavor is more open ended, and where you can go nuts riffing your own ideas.\n\nBesides this, there are a handful of simple physical facts that make a profound difference in your understanding of what you're cooking.\n\nWhat we commonly call browning is a complex chain of things called the Maillard reaction. This is essential to building flavor in many if not most savory dishes. It's also what makes bread taste delicious even though raw flour is basically inedible. While the reaction begins happening at lower temperatures, 350F is the inflection point of where it starts happening rapidly. As a simple example of how useful this fact is: you can quite easily get a roast turkey to have great crispy skin as well as juicy interior. Use a thermometer to understand where the interior is at. Use your eyes, nose, and scraping with a utensil to understand where the skin is at. If the skin is browning faster than the interior is coming up to temp, back your oven down to 325F or lower. If the interior is getting mostly there but the skin is looking lackluster crank it up to 425F or use the broiler.\n\nA very simple but important related fact is that a liquid mixture will not, on the average, rise above the boiling point of the liquid. You can boil broccoli all day and it won't brown. Put it in the oven and you get something entirely different.\n\nLikewise, collagen, the connective tissue in meat begins decomposing into gelatin around 160F if it's in a moist environment. Again this is an inflection point, and there's a bit of that at lower temps. Fat begins to render (liquify) at around 130F, depending on the specific fat. Proteins denature (read as, go from translucent to opaque, and shrink in the direction of the fibers) at temps above 110F. These facts combine to tell you how to cook nearly any meat properly. Cuts of meat high in collagen should be cooked via moist cooking methods, and taken to fairly high temperatures to allow the fat and collagen to turn into a gelatin that coats the meat fibers. Compared to a steak the meat is way past well done, but the mentioned processes compensate for this producing that utterly tender fall apart texture of stews and great BBQ. Conversely, lean cuts should be handled carefully to avoid overcooking, at which point you'll have all the tight overcooked protein fibers and nothing to compensate for it.\n\nLastly, you can look at mirepoix, sofrito (of all it's variations across the med and americas), the cajun trinity, etc and see these are all the same fundamental idea and purpose, just a different flavor combination. Same for how a roux is commonly used to provide both flavor and thickening. Once you start seeing these big picture patterns across different culinary traditions, you can improvise your own things that hit the same notes of flavor and mental association (though do not ignore where specific traditions diverge).\n\nPast that it's about learning technique, and how the results of choices in technique generalize. A great example is garlic. Whole vs sliced vs diced vs crushed produce different balances of sweet vs sharply sulfuric flavor. How long you cook garlic, onion, or similar things changes the balance of sharp vs caramelized sweet flavors.\n\nAnyhow, that's a bit of a ranty brain dump, but reflects the big anchor ideas in how I approach cooking. I don't bill myself as a skilled chef. I am good enough to cook food on a regular basis that makes people literally do a double take. It's very near the top of my list of most satisfying things I've learned how to do."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Suggestions for Culinary School type exercises for a home cook? [/INST] This was effectively my Culinary Foundations 1/2 class:\n\nBuy a massive bag of carrots, potatoes, and onions, and get chopping. Download and print a  knife cuts guide. Learn large dice, then cut that into medium and small. Cut batons, cut that into small dice. Cut julienne, cut that into brunoise. Make sure your knife is sharp as all fuck. Go \\*slow\\* and be super precise at first. Make them perfect, don't go for speed. You'll get faster over time. Practice this literally like 15-30 minutes per day every day (or more if you like), because that's how you get good. That's how I spent the first few months of culinary school.\n\nLearn how to emulsify a vinaigrette from scratch. Make mayonnaise from scratch. Make stock, and then learn to make the mother sauces (Instant pot is fucking fabulous for this, by the way...it's good to learn how to make a chicken stock from scratch once and skim it and stuff, but honestly if you have the IP don't bother after that, and don't bother making beef or veal stock without one).\n\nlearn how to make consomme.\n\nMove onto making the perfect seared airline chicken breast and steak. Key if you're cooking at home though is to dry the meat in the fridge uncovered overnight, you get a much better crust that way.\n\nLearn how to make a pan sauce from the pan you've cooked your meats in.\n\nLearn to poach chicken and fish in a flavorful broth.\n\nLearn to make great polenta, rice, rice pilaf, and a couple other grains of your choice.\n\nLearn how to properly blanch veggies and finish them in a nice buttery sauce.\n\nLearn how to make a roast. Learn how to braise (in school we made a cartouche--a braising lid out of parchment paper)\n\nPractice some basic plating. Everyone has different styles, so spend some time googling around and see what you like. Cutting meats on a bias and trimming veggies on a bias makes things hecka fancy looking and takes no extra time.\n\nLEARN HOW TO SEASON WITH SALT PROPERLY. If you're not sure, keep adding more and more and tasting every single fucking thing every step of the way until it's too much. Most of the time people don't realize how much salt things need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost importantly though--learn the food science. Culinary school didn't teach as much of this as I would have liked, but it's so goddamn important to know if you want to be able to get very good. Otherwise you're just repeating what you've practiced, and that might not be the best approach if you don't understand why what you're doing is great. I always like to call Serious Eats my second culinary school for this reason."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why does butter change the flavor of steak so dramatically? [/INST] Personally, I have found butter to add beneficial flavour to all meat.  I can't think of any that doesn't benefit.  Beef, pork, chicken, lamb, goat, fish, shellfish.  All better with butter.\n\nI think there is a stronger tradition of butter with beef because traditionally you could have gotten those two from the same farmer.\n\nAs for why beef tastes better with butter then oil.  I think it has to do with our taste sense of fats/lipids.  So recently there has been the discovery of g-coupled protein receptors for fats.  So we have dedicated taste receptors for fats/fatty acids. \n\nNow if you look at the chemical composition of butter and oil there's one stark difference.  The lipids in milk/butter are shorter (primarily of carbon chains of 4, 6, 8 and 10).  The lipids derived from plants tend to be longer (carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being the most common).  Interesting, looking at beef fat(tallow, also other animal based fats are similar) it is very similar to plant fats with carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being predominant.\n\nSo my theory is that these short lipids (C:4-10) hit our lipid g-coupled protein receptors on our tounges different and butter fills in that flavour profile.  For one, smaller molecules have more mobility and could potentially get to our lipid receptors more readily then longer chain fats.  Also, the receptors themselves could be more susceptible to shorter chain fats much like our amino acid receptors are most susceptible to glutamate.\n\nAnd I do think it's the fats instead of some other flavour in butter because fats+water in butter makes up 98%-99% of its composition.  The others will help, but this is how I see it."}

Then, make tomato soup and add leeks), tomato southwestern (corn, tomatoes, corn chips, salt, lime, beans and ground beef if you want)\n\nROASTED TOMATOES: Shove em in the oven wrapped tightly in aluminum foil at 450 for 35 minutes, until just blackened\n\nSTUFFED TOMATOES: Do roasted tomatoes but shove some other stuff in em. Rice, beans, children if you're feeling spooky\n\nSALSA: 2 tomatoes, half a jalapeno, half tablespoon of fine salt, large pinch of flaky salt, half an onion, garlic bits, whatever else goes in salsa\n\nROASTED SALSA: same but roast it, and then add some more savory and smoky ingredients, like corn, corn chips, bacon, chipotle powder, paprika, smoked flaky salt\n\nHOT SAUZE: look up joshua weissman hot sauce on youtube and follow the recipe but use completely different peppers. A mix of cherry bombs (15%), poblanos (35%), jalapenos (10%), habaneros (5%), and buffer peppers (35%) os good. Instead of a pound and a half, ferment only a pound, and then replace the other half pound with tomatoes. You can also just make the recipe like normal except you happened to put in 3 tomatoes and changed nothing else. It's a robust recipe.\n\nITALIANS: fill a giant saucepot with butter and tomatoes. Use a stick of butter per baby's volume of tomatoes (about 10 tomatoes). For every two babies' volume of tomatoes (about 15-20), add one onion that you washed but did not peel, and you chopped directly in half and did nothing else to. Add a bucket of salt and then bring to a simmer while stirring. After 20 minutes taste it to see how acidic it is, and add sugar to reduce acidity until it tastes good. You can also roast these tomatoes first, which I would recommend because you have green tomatoes\n\nSMOOTHIE: Like original v8, but just as bad. Fill your blender with tomatoes. Roasted might be better. Then, squeeze out a quarter of a lime for each tomato you put in, maybe a bit less. Add a bit of salt and a lot of hot sauce. Blend. Serve to people in the 80's and tell them that they are supposed to enjoy it.\n\nTOMATO REDUCTION: Take a tomato and blend it, then cook until it's pasty and weird. put a dollop on a plate and move it around with a spoon to make your food look fancy.\n\nFISH DISH: Fry up some cheap fish fillet with salt, pepper, lemon pepper, and sadness, until just blackened. Chop up a tomato on top, keeping the juices so they sizzle when they touch the hot fish and mix with the lemon that you squirted on earlier. PS you shouldve done that earlier. It should sizzle too. Call it salsa verde or something.\n\nAN ENTIRE PIG: Slowly roast an entire pig on an authentic hawaiian grill for 12 full hours while dancing and saluting the sun and the earth's bounty. When nearly finished, place a single tomato inside the pig's mouth to finish. Repeat until all 600lb are used up.\n\nPOWDER AND THEN CHIPS: If you know more than I do about tortilla chip making, you can try to make a powder out of reduced and dehydrated green tomatoes, and then mix the powder with the corn flour when making tortilla chips. Should be tasty.\n\nFRIENDS: Make more friends, and then tell them that for a small entry fee, they too can share with their friends the great bounty of the green tomato, sold at a great deal vs. other competitors, exclusive offer, not a pyramid scheme.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!"}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Is homemade ice cream texture determined more by the machine you buy, or your technique in making it? [/INST] Ice cream texture is a function of recipe, overrun, and freezing time. Recipe is the easy part, but overrun and freezing time are entirely a function of the ice cream machine you use. Non-compressor machines will typically give you a freezing time of 20-30 minutes while a compressor will give you 12-18 minutes, both for 1 L of base. That difference in time has a significant impact on the texture of the ice cream. Overrun depends on the paddle type and rotation speed of the machine, but most home machines will provide a similar overrun - very high overrun typically requires commercial machines.\n\nYou'll want to look for a machine with the shortest freezing time possible. Something like a Lello 4080 is ideal but there are cheaper options available like the Breville Smart Scoop or the Cuisinart ICE-100. The more you pay the better the result generally, and when it comes to ice cream machines the price can skyrocket pretty fast, so you'll have to decide what is reasonable for your budget (and counter space)."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] How did this restaurant cut their carrots like this? Diagram inside. [/INST] Ah, the ancient, sadistic French culinary tradition of tournage. The blessed craft of turning vegetables into seven sided footballs, a practice designed to torture culinary students into finger cramped insanity.  And yes, it is usually done by hand and ask any ancient French chef to do it and they will execute them perfectly without even looking at their hands while doing so. Something that brings great shame to all who witness.  I can still smell the mounds of turnips that I used to practice making into these [bastard shapes](https://imgur.com/1mhCGhT) with a bird's beak knife.\n\nThe word “tournage” comes from the French verb tourner, which means “to turn.” To tourner, or “turn,” vegetables is to cut them into faceted-oval shapes — usually with seven sides — with blunt ends. While the shape is always the same, tournage cuts have varying names depending upon their length. \"BCVCF\"- Bouquetière- 3cm, Cocotte- 5cm, Vapeur- 6cm, Château- 7-ish cm and Fondante- massive. I am now having flashbacks to my culinary school finals.\n\nThese are one of the traditional taillage cuts like julienne and brunoise that are uniform in French cuisine. They are uniform for several reasons- visual appeal, the same size for even cooking and so every cook in a kitchen makes them the exact same way. \n\nThat said, in all my years as a chef, I think I have had tourned vegetable on maybe two menus. Its more about developing knife skills and discipline.\n\nIf those carrots were done in a super traditional French way, they would have been cooked à l’étuvée. In a pan with butter, salt, water and sometimes a little sugar and then a parchment paper lid over the top so that they gently simmer and steam and develop a shiny glaze.\n\nI need to go lay down now."}

Temperature is what you think it is and heat is temperature times mass. When you deglaze, you have the same temperature differential as dipping the pan in a giant body of cold water, but not the same heat differential because the mass of the pan vs the tiny bit of liquid you put in it is overwhelming and the liquid just heats up quickly and the pan only cools down at a rate relatively equal and opposite the heat it takes the heat the water.

It isn’t thickening, so don’t think of it as roux, think of it like you would think of pressing bits of cold butter into flour for a pasty crust, but the opposite - no thin flakes of butter like a croissant or puff pastry would have, more of a saturated flour that can disperse and make the bread tender.\n\nBravo grandma 👏"}

{"text":"<s> [INST] What is the difference between marinating chicken for 30mins vs 2 hours vs 12 hours? [/INST] Most marinades won’t penetrate chicken much past a couple hours. And most don’t actually make the chicken more tender. Some marinades even make the chicken unpleasant if left too long. On the other hand salting chicken and leaving it for 12 hours in the fridge actually tenderizes the chicken. So, for me, I look at the recipe and see what it’s doing to decide what to actually do. If it says to marinate the chicken overnight in an acidic marinade I ignore and do 2 hours. Maybe I’ll have dry brined it the night before with just salt. If the same marinade is being used to prepare the chicken when you cook it, that’s where all the flavor is coming from. So I ignore lots of recipes that call for long marinades. At the same time, I do think there’s a difference between a half hour and say an hour and a half, if the chicken wasn’t brined already."}
{"text":"<s> [INST] Why is white pepper more commonly pre-ground in Asia compared to black pepper? [/INST] Ok so I spent a lot of time in southern China where peppercorns are cultivated heavily. The real answer is that when you grind peppercorns (black or white), it exposes the oils inside to the air and it starts to lose its spiciness and oxidize, giving pre-ground pepper that stale, metallic flavor very quickly. In black pepper, this flavor isn’t desirable. That’s why black pepper grinders are so commonplace - the fresh black pepper has a much cleaner flavor that’s preferred so many places grind it fresh. The opposite is true of white pepper (actually the same peppercorn, just without the black outer skin) The white peppercorns are produced by soaking the skins off, which can give them a slightly fermented flavor depending on the length of the soaking process. Once the peppercorns are then ground, that fermented flavor combines with the metallic flavor of the oxidizing oils. This gives the ground white pepper a strong, funky smell/taste that develops over time, and this flavor is actually often preferred to the cleaner, just-ground white pepper flavor especially in *certain East Asian cuisines.\n\nIf someone is using just-ground white pepper, it is usually like other comments mention - it’s similar enough to black pepper when fresh ground that you can use it as a substitute when the lighter color is important to the final dish aesthetic.\n\n*edited to reflect that this differs from region to region, some cuisines will use fresh ground white pepper for its lighter flavor"}

To the person who posted the first question (\"what types of recipes needed the most revising?\"), not sure what happened, but here's our answer:\n\nIt's hard to generalize with regard to recipe type. In general, the more complicated a recipe, the more motivated we were to update and improve it... Cassoulet and Seafood and Sausage Paella come to mind. We did not try to \"dumb them down,\" but the way they had been written in previous editions made them more complicated and inflexible than they needed to be.\n\nWe were also making more broad changes to different sections of the book. For instance, in the Vegetables chapter, we wanted to respond to the way people are cooking vegetables now. Back in the 70s (and before), folks were cooking vegetables to death. Then in the 80s and 90s there was a backlash, and \"crisp-tender\" became very popular. Now folks are kind of swinging back to the middle of the spectrum, acknowledging that, depending on the vegetable, they can be excellent crisp-tender or cooked beyond that.\n\nThen there was the cake chapter. A lot of the older layer cake recipes had you separate the eggs, then beat the whites and fold them into the batter. We did a bunch of side-by-side tests on these cakes to see if whipping the egg whites was necessary. We found that the difference was minimal and that we preferred the cakes with whole eggs rather than separated ones. We think this is a preference that has changed over time: folks used to prefer lighter cakes, and now we like them a little richer."}

I have hEDS too, and though my grip strength is alright I can still empathize with clumsy and awkward and stupid fragile skin.\n\nYour basic [cut resistant gloves](https://nocry.com/products/nocry-microdot-cut-resistant-gloves) are a spandex-fibreglass-polyethylene weave. I've seen them in discount stores, so they're fairly affordable. They feel like a knit fabric, are flexible and grip quite well, and will protect you most of the time. You'll find that the mandoline will cut small slices in the fingertips of the gloves PARTICULARLY if the glove is too large for you, and they need to be washed (you can throw them in with your laundry) after using.\n\nA slightly tougher option is the same glove but with a [polyurethane coating](https://www.werko.com.au/product/stealth-razor-cut-5-resistant-gloves) on the palm and fingertips. They feel a little stiffer, which could be difficult if grip strength is an issue, but the PU coating has more friction than the knit fabric of the first option so it's a trade off there. This style will last a bit longer before the cuts in the fingertips build up, but take a while to dry after washing so if you want to use them every day you may need more than one.\n\nMy personal favourite is an actual [steel mesh glove](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resistant-Stainless-Butcher-Cutting-Chopping/dp/B07FP5HYLH/ref=asc_df_B07FP5HYLH)! Not quite chain mail but it's tough, super easy to wash without starting a load of laundry, dries quickly and doesn't get stained or soggy the way knit gloves do. The downside is that they're a bit slipperier and you're supposed to wear a thin cotton glove inside them, though of course you can skip that. If planning to wear one without the cotton glove, go a size down.\n\nAnother suggestion just in general is to wrap a bandaid or a thin piece of strapping tape over the tip of the fingers on your slicing hand before putting the glove on. Mostly it's the first joint of your finger that's in danger with a mandoline. (EDIT: you can do strapping tape over your palm too, if slicing flat-handed.) It doesn't have any noticeable effect on grip strength, the bandaid can't fall into the food through the glove, and you get an extra layer of protection in case the blade gets through the glove. There are other options like [steel finger guards](https://au.grandado.com/products/4pcs-set-adjustable-stainless-steel-finger-hand-guard-finger-protector-knife-slice-chop-safe-slice-cooking-tools) but I really want my whole hand covered i.e. a glove when operating a mandoline.\n\nAll links are examples only, not purchase recommendations as I don't know where you live/what size hands you have/etc. Happy to help narrow it down to a specific affordable option once you know what you're looking for."}

The mechanical process creates a sticky, cohesive filling. Its the difference between barely shoving meat together for the tender texture of a meatball vs. the other end of the spectrum, grinding meat for a snappy sausage. Mechanically working it starts to break down the protein structure, including one of the two major contracting filaments, the protein myosin, while squeezing out the trapped water. Myosin begins to coagulate at the relatively low temperature of 120ºF/50ºC which then leads to a more solid and firm texture in the end product. \n\nEnd result= dumplings work better with a stickier, developed filling."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Do spices actually expire? [/INST] When we talk about expiration in food, there are 2 types of expiration: food safety expiration (typically worded \"use by\") and food quality expiration (typically worded \"best before\")\n\nMost spices don't have a \"food safety\" expiration as they're, genetically speaking, not hospitable to bacteria and fungus which is what usually make people sick. They're even used as preservatives. \n\nWhat they do have is a \"food quality\" expiration, because they have volatile compounds that will disperse into the air (making the spice lose potency) and oxidize (making the spice taste off / rancid / lose color). That happens quicker when they're in powder form. Another thing that can happen is they can absorb moisture and cake into a super hard disk inside your jar, sometimes \"melt\" (usually things like bouillon cubes, premix and the occasional onion / garlic powder are prone to melting)\n\nIn your case, I recommend going through the cabinet and tossing everything that looks obviously moldy. Then do a color / sniff / taste test (IN THAT ORDER) of the test and see if it's still good / useable"}
{"text":"<s> [INST] Keeping hands and cooking utensils clean while cooking [/INST] There are a few techniques. First, they probably wash their hands more than they show on camera. Proper hand washing is a cornerstone of safe food preparation.\n\nSecond, one of the best ways to minimize the need for handwashing is to work in order from your \"least dangerous\" foods to your \"most dangerous\" ones. That means you start by prepping all your produce that's fine to eat raw before you start prepping your meats. And if you have multiple meats that you need to touch, you go in order of ascending final temperature (e.g. handle a steak or a piece of fish before you handle a chicken breast). You can still wash your hands between ingredients, but it's more for comfort and convenience than safety if you can stick to this pattern (sometimes it's inconvenient to do this way though, depending on the recipe).\n\nNOTE: If everything is going to be cooked to a safe temperature, it's not all that important to avoid cross-contamination between different ingredients. But it's still a good habit to get into nonetheless.\n\nThird, specifically around salt, most chefs are using loose salt rather than salt in a grinder. It happens to usually be Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, but any salt will do once you learn how much to use. With loose salt, you can easily pour some into a container to use for your recipe, and then discard what's leftover (or add the salt back into your container, since nothing will really grow on the salt itself). There is no benefit to \"freshly ground\" salt, since it doen't lose flavor over time after grinding.\n\nSince pepper is best ground fresh (as are other spices), the most hygenic compromise between flavor and convenience is to grind a bunch of pepper (or the amount of a spice that you need) before you start cooking, and if you have any leftover after cooking discard what's left. That way you don't have to handle the grinder with dirty hands, but still have fresh pepper. And again, you want to try to season things in order from least to most dangerous. You don't want to touch chicken, then touch your pepper, then use that same pepper to season a salad."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Is mixing spices before putting them on the food better than just sprinkling them one by one? [/INST] As an Indian, I think I can add a little bit or a lot of depth to the discussion. We treat spices very differently compared to most cuisines. First of all, know what you want to do with the spices and what you want them to do for you. Same spice can give you very different flavours depending on how you treat it. For example, coriander seeds, toasted and ground, when added to fat and cooked at low temperature will impart an earthiness but smoke it high and it'll give you a smoky flavor. Toast it and cook it whole and you'll get a slightly different aroma with texture. And so on and so forth. Another example is fennel seeds. Toast it, grind it and add in a sauce on top. It'll give you a sweet cool aromatic finish on the palate. Compare that to fennel powder that is crushed without toasting. The sweetness of latter is more natural and not that concentrated. Compare still to fennel powder added during cooking process in a dish like roghan josh. The flavor is more complicated and hard. Similarly, prosciutto uses fennel powder at times as far as I'm aware but curing makes it taste very different. So on and so forth. \n\n\nSo to sum it up, you've to learn to cook with spices. Figure out which ones you like the most and figure out which profiles you want to emphasize while cooking certain foods. That'll help you understand different stages at which you can add spices. To give you an idea, here are different ways to add spices to your food. \n\n1. Toast them, grind to a mix - you can use this mix as a seasoning or a rub for marinade. \n\n2. Add powdered or whole spices (procured from stores) to sauces with fat, sauté them to release aroma and cook sauce to finish. Examples include cloves, bay leaf, cilantro seeds etc.\n\n3. Add spices before finishing to infuse the sauce with aromatics. Good example is saffron. Another is nutmeg or mace. Cooked too long, these spices will lose aroma. Cooked too little they can be too strong to be palatable. \n\n4. Add spices as finish. Examples include cumin powder, saffron (used correctly), cardamom, cinnamon etc.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about spices. For example, grinding (in grinder) versus pulverising (in mortar pestle) and other minor considerations that become very prominent in traditional cuisines that use spices heavily.\n\nEdit- Thanks for the response. I didn't know you guys would appreciate it so much. You might find a more detailed explanation on spices more interesting.

Or if you're making pancakes, you can do it at night and come to it in the morning.\n\nAs an aside, if you use cream (even UHT cream) and do the same thing for a full 24 hours, together with a tiny splash of vinegar to taste you can make a very convincing sour cream substitute. \n\nIf you don't feel like going through that whole song and dance, you can also just use yoghurt straight up, though note that it'll have a bit more of that yoghurt-y tang to it.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why should I heat up the pan 1st and then add oil? [/INST] A few reasons:\n\n1. Helps prevent burning your oil if you leave it on the heat.  The pan is hot, you put in the oil and pretty much immediately follow with food.  The food cools the oil and as it cooks and releases water content it regulates the oil's temperature.  If you leave oil alone in a pan as it's heating it's way easier to accidentally leave it and have it start smoking and polymerizing\n2. Metal is porous and sometimes in certain types of pans (definitely happens in scratched up stainless steel pans sometimes) there can be moisture essentially trapped in the metal.  If you get the pan hot it will force that moisture to evaporate, but if instead there's a layer of fat on top of it, when it finally does get hot enough it can essentially \"explode\" (at a small scale) and splatter oil\n3. If you are going for a really hard sear, such as with a steak, you can get the pan way hotter than you can get oil (or you want to get oil).  Example: Let's say you are searing a steak in a cast iron, which can hold a lot of heat energy.  You get the cast iron to say around 600F.  Add a touch of oil and immediately put the steak in.  The steak cools the pan but all that extra heat the pan had by being at 600 is going to make it so that it won't cool *too much* and will still be at searing temperatures of \\~400F ideally.  However, if you had started with a cold pan with oil in it, by the time the pan gets to 400F the oil is at 400F and the oil starts smoking (depending on its smoke point and what kind of oil you're using).  This means you can't get the pan up to 600F because the oil will just be smoking itself to smithereens and will taste awful (and probably set off your fire alarm).  In this scenario it is better if your pan is somewhat over-preheated before you add the oil (be careful though, if your pan is significantly above the flash point of the oil you are using the oil could immediately ignite upon contact with the pan -- I have both seen others do this and done it myself in restaurants I've worked in when I left a pan on the french top too long before putting oil in it)"}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why do some people recommend to heat the empty pan before adding any fat ? [/INST] It depends. For lower heats, it really doesn’t matter. However, if you’re at a higher heat, there is a good reason to add the fat in after the pan is heated: smoking. \n\nIf you put the fat in a cold pan and heat it up to a high temp, there will be a long period of time when the fat passes it’s smoke point but the pan isn’t up to the desired temp yet. That whole time, the oil is releasing smoke in your kitchen. \n\nAlternatively, if you heat the pan to the desired temp and then add the fat, there might still be a period when it smokes. This time, however, it’s only the few seconds it takes you to put in the thing you’re cooking. And if you’re quick enough, you can even avoid that.\n\nFor example, when I stir fry, I first heat my wok up as high as it will go. Then, add some oil, swirl it around, and as soon as it starts shimmering toss in whatever I’m stir frying.\n\nAll this is dependent on the heat you’re turning the pan up to and the smoke point of the fat you’re using."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why is it easier for a Japanese restaurant to get a 4.5+ star rating than a Thai place? [/INST] Online reviews such as from Google and Yelp have lots of variability.  A lot of Asian restaurants in general have very swingy reviews because people with and without an understanding of the cultures will read things very differently.

Deliver food when it's ready, piping hot, and clear away dirty dishes, bringing the check quickly - these are signs of efficient and great service at many Asian restaurants, but they can be off-putting to people accustomed to European dining, where you bring all plates out at once, course the meal, and let diners take their time before clearing the table or bringing the bill. \n\nThere is also a lot of hype around Japanese food - especially Americanized sushi (mayo, massive rolls, lots of fried ingredients and spicy sauces) - so many restaurants (smartly) focus on presentation, which gets higher reviews from people who are looking for an experience, rather than an appreciation of traditional, quality Japanese food, which would seem bland and unexciting to many used to nontraditional versions.   \n\nI always look at who is reviewing (what kinds of places they tend to like) and what they're saying about the place before weighting what they say.  I also check the menu to see what is being served - is it really Americanized, does it look like it appeals to the party crowd?  - to give context to what kind of place it is. \n\nBecause of all these factors, it really won't make sense to compare ethnicity of restaurants and the reviews they get - different types of people go to these places, and the people rating have very diverse standards for what they're looking for."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why do I need to use an entire pot of boiling water and how do I know when I can skip it. [/INST] When you add food to boiling water, it brings down the water's temperature.  The temperature of a shallow pan of boiling water is going to be brought down much much more than the temperature of a large pot of boiling water because the shallow pan of water contains less total energy (I'm sure there's a more specific thermodynamic term for this. I tried googling, but I'm kinda out of my element).           \n\n\nI believe that is part of why pasta packaging seems to suggest much more water than it seems is necessary.  If you have enough water, the water will come back to a boil quickly after adding pasta.  With less, it can take several minutes to come back to a boil.  How long it takes to come back to a boil can vary depending on the power of the stove, the material of the pan or pot, whether the lid is on the pot, etc.          \nUsing a lot of water evens the playing field and allows for more consistent result given all of the potential variables.          \n         \n \nEdit: People have replied with comments and [this article](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-cook-pasta-salt-water-boiling-tips-the-food-lab) below refuting my claim about how long something would take to come back to a boil.

{"text":"<s> [INST] What does washing rice actually *do*, and when to apply/not apply? [/INST] There is no one hard and fast rule or reasoning for any or all rice- different varieties, different applications, different cultures all impact if rice gets washed/aka rinsed/soaked/tossed into a pot as is, etc.\n\n* Where the rice is from and how it is stored may dictate that it gets washed to remove detritus of the packaging or storage process, remove dirt or other impurities, etc., not just starch. My Singaporean step mother kept the rice in a garbage bag in a huge bucket in the garage. That shit got rinsed.\n\n* If the end result desired is rice that does not clump it gets rinsed- often sushi, jasmine, etc. One of the biggest complaints is people getting mushy results from a high end rice cooker and when you drill down, you find out they don't rinse their rice. [Watch a YT of an expert sushi rice maker](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hsBHBMrm-wg&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE) and you'll see that sushi rice ain't no joke.\n\n* Method of cooking can also impact if it gets washed or soaked. A lot of dishes that use basmati call for soaking the rice. I am sure someone more knowledgeable when it comes to basmati will come thundering out of the bush to add to this.\n\n* For congee or risotto, two very different types of rice but both starchy applications, do not get washed [unless impurities are a concern.]  Starch release is a big part of what makes both wonderfully creamy.\n\n* Having grown up around the world, culture plays a big part in how we deal with food [see also every damn post about washing chicken] but Asian cultures tend to wash/soak, etc. their rice more than people who grew up in families that eat rice once in a blue moon. I first ate rice in Texas where it was served wet, with a pat of margarine and no salt. My mother could rock out tamales but rice? The rice gods should have struck her down."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] What's the difference between using lime (green colored) and lemon (yellow colored) in my food? [/INST] Food science answer: They have very extensive volatile flavor differences. Both contain relatively the same concentration of citric acid in their juice, so there won't be much of an acidity difference. It comes down to the flavor that each brings. Lemons contain higher concentrations of \"light\" and \"candylike\" flavor compounds (aldehydes like citral and terpenes like pinene) which is why they are used more often to \"lift\" or \" brighten\" dishes, where lime has many more \"heavy\" and \"floral\" flavor compounds (like fenchyl alcohol and terpineol) that can complement and cut through many strong flavor profiles. Cuisine plays a huge part to be sure, but both play different roles in adding acidity to various dishes."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Cooked a whole chicken with potatoes, onions and carrots in a dutch oven. Can I achieve the same taste by doing it again without the meat ? [/INST] Probably not exactly, but you can likely experiment  with a few things that might move you in the right direction. The chicken is adding a few things:\n\n1. Umami flavor. To replace this, you probably want to add at least one umami-heavy ingredient, like some tomato paste or marmite.\n2. Gelatin. The fact that you described the veggies as caramelized indicates that most of the water in the pan evaporated and you got some nice browning. In meats, it's mainly proteins that are browning; in vegetables it's mainly sugars. That sort of sticky browning flavor might be in part due to browning of the gelatin that comes out of the chicken as it cooks. So maybe bloom some unflavored gelatin in your chicken stock before using it, so there will be proteins that can brown.\n3. Fat. The chicken skin renders and releases schmaltz. There's no other flavor quite like schmaltz, but you can replace it with another fat that will serve the same function for browning purposes and add a flavor of its own. I would *not* go with something totally neutral like canola oil...if you're gonna add fat, might as well go with something that will add good flavor like olive oil, butter, or ghee.\n4. Water. The chicken will release some moisture as it cooks. You may find that you need to increase the amount of chicken stock you use if you aren't using the meat. I think adding wine is a good move because it adds more sugars that can caramelize a bit, and also adds acidity that can offset all the richness. HOWEVER, know that browning won't really happen until the water evaporates, so you don't want too much liquid.\n\nIt likely won't come out perfectly the first time as you tweak the different variables, including the above plus what vessel you cook it in, how much time they spend covered/uncovered,  and what temperature you cook in."}

You can convert some of the citric acid into to sodium citrate for some very easy cheese sauces.

We'll call them \"snacking ports\" ideally on a hinge you can open and close to keep debris or german children out.\n\nYou'll also need some heaters and a pumping mechanism like a screw auger. It can run indefinitely with periodic additions of more chocolate and small amounts of coconut oil which, when gently heated, will help keep things flowing smoothly. Perhaps some anti-oxidants to stave off some of the oxidization over the years, but that also brings us to the *solera* part of the chocolate solera river.\n\nIn distilling/brewing, there is a solera concept where you continuously add distillates to the same container for aging and use. e.g., you add your first year's rum, then your second year's, and now you have a blend of rum that's between 1&2 years old. You keep doing this year after year until you have a smoothly blended rum with the harsh notes from the yearly rum you're adding diluted and mellowed by the years before. For a chocolate solera you'd be reversing this, with the fresh chocolate additions diluting anything that's become oxidized."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] My Father can't admit his french fries sucks, need help. [/INST] Double-frying is a better option, though it will take planning - and space.\n\nIdeally, you need 2 fryers. One at 325F, one at 350F. Fry a batch at the lower heat until soft, then take them out & let them cool. Then finish them off at the higher temp.\n\nBasically what this does is the 1st fry heats up all the water in the potato. the cooling lets all that water emerge & evaporate off. Then the 2nd fry crisps the outside - but all the water is gone so when you take them out to serve, that water isn't escaping & turning them soggy.\n\nSo to do this, you need to plan your batches...and have the space to lay the fries out to cool (they shouldn't be just tossed in a bowl because they won't cool fast enough & the potato starches will make them all stick together)\n\nEdit: Just noticing you're boiling first. And that's a problem, since you're literally adding in a bunch of water that then steams off when you take them out of the fry oil & makes them soggy."}
{"text":"<s> [INST] I don’t understand Al Dente [/INST] Nah, I think you're absolutely right. It varies person to person.

But I feel the one you can most easily keep checking, and tell the difference, is fresh pasta. There's a pretty specific point where it doesn't stick to your teeth, but also isn't mush. Amd within that window there's a few different points. And imo, that is al dente. At which point, to each their own.\n\nI've found that with dried pasta, if you boil it till close to the stick to your teeth point, and then turn it off and let it sit for a few minutes, it gets pretty evenly al dente.  \n\nImo, its meaning that its not gonna just mush when you bite it.

{"text":"<s> [INST] What makes a palate cleanser capable of cleansing palates? And what happens, chemically speaking, when a palate gets cleansed? [/INST] When eating savoury dishes, two things happen, an abundance of salt dulls the palate and fat coats the tongue, inhibiting the ability to distinguish flavours. Something mildly acidic, and usually a bit sweet, will cut thru this and re-set the palate. Thats why lemon sorbet is a frequent popular option for a palate cleanser.\n\nAsk any cook who is tasting the same dishes over and over again in a professional setting and they'll tell you all about palate fatigue. I frequently have to ask someone else to taste a dish because I can no longer taste something rich and salty after a while- especially a thick, salty sauce.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Tapioca pearls: how do you get the perfect sweetness and consistency? [/INST] I worked at a bubble tea shop for a couple of years so here's my two cents:\n\n- After you finish cooking the boba, make sure you thoroughly rinse it in cold water until they are no longer hot. Aim for a temperature of a less than lukewarm, but not ice cold. This process helps retain the \"qq\" or chewy texture and prevents your bubbles from getting too soft.\n\n-Use a lot more sugar than you think you need!!! We used something like a 1:4 ratio of brown sugar( honey works great as well) to water to soak our bubbles in. After about 30 minutes, the bubbles taste their best. They should've absorbed most of the sugar at that point, while retaining the texture.\n\n- The 5 minute instant cook boba from the local Asian grocery store are fine, but I've been using those since I was a kid and I could never recreate store bought taste & texture. It may be worth trying to make homemade tapioca(working on this myself!) pearls or buying store quality boba like this one: https://www.amazon.com/Tea-Zone-Tapioca-Bag-Pound/dp/B007LA06Y2\nIf you do buy this brand, you'll notice that these bubbles crumble which is more similar to homemade/fresh bubbles as opposed to the store bought bubbles that are drier and harder\n\nI hope this helps a lil :)\n\nEdit: \nOne more quick tip! \nIf you tends to clump together, I suggest that during the rinsing process you use your hand to separate the boba. You want to squeeze the boba, like you're grabbing a stress ball, and it will separate the boba. You can use a spatula to do the separation, but I find using your hand to separate the bubbles works the best.\n\n~please don't burn yourself, only start separating when the bubbles have cooled a bit~"}

{"text":"<s> [INST] I bought a 25lb bag of flour from Costco because it was cheaper per Oz, how do I store it and preserve it? [/INST] The following is a paragraph from The Bread Bible by Rose Levy Berenbaum:\n\n>**Freshness**   \nI have to confess that for years I never believed flour could get stale, as long as I couldn’t smell any off flavors, but I was dead wrong. I learned the now-unforgettable lesson when developing the recipe for the baguette. No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get those lovely open holes in the crumb. I called everyone I could think of, and somewhere along the line someone suggested that maybe it was the flour. What I was using was three years old. I bought a new batch and the favorable results forever changed the way I think about the shelf life of any dry ingredient. I learned that unless you freeze flour, it is essential to date it the moment you bring it into the house and then ruthlessly throw it out after 3 months if it’s whole wheat or rye, after one year if it’s white flour. No ifs, ands, or buts. As flour ages, it loses its strength. If it isn’t stored airtight, it will absorb air in a humid environment or dry out in a dry environment. Only cake flour, which is chlorine bleached, seems to have a virtually indefinite shelf life, if stored airtight. Flour isn’t expensive enough to risk wasting your time with an expired one. Excess oxidation is the enemy of good bread. In the mixing phase, a certain amount of incorporated air is desirable, but in ground flour, undesirable oxidation starts to takes place from the moment the grain is cracked and exposed to air. This is why the whole unground grain can keep for as long as five years, if cleaned and kept dry and cool, but whole wheat flour keeps for only about 3 months. A common practice in milling is to moisten the grains to make separation of the bran easier. One of the benefits of this practice is that the bran flakes into attractive little pieces instead of powdering and merely darkening the bread. If the moistening and drying is done quickly, there is no down side, but if not, the moisture is likely to activate enzymes that will cause the flour to deteriorate more quickly. If you are in doubt as to whether your whole grains are still viable after prolonged storage, soak some of the grains in water. If most of them don’t start to germinate (sprout) after 2 or 3 days, the grain is no longer alive and should be discarded.\n\nBeranbaum, Rose Levy. The Bread Bible (Kindle Locations 11203-11214). W.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why are pretzels in N. America depicted upside down when compared to European pretzels? [/INST] Boy did this turn into a rabbit hole for me.  I'm a huge pretzel fanatic. Growing up in South East Pennsylvania, this was not an anomaly.  PA is crazy about pretzels thanks to our historically high German population.  I've done a bit of digging and, though I won't say it's conclusive, have an idea of why the quintessential American pretzel is often displayed differently.  \n\nThis [article](http://travelhungry.co/blog/2014/6/21/breakfast-at-backerei-frank) on German pretzels makes a very short and frank statement: \"[T]he twist in American soft pretzels is the same width as the bottom and sides of the pretzel, the twist on German pretzels is much thinner, giving you a crispy treat after you enjoy the soft body. This explains why when you see German pretzels, they usually appear \"upside-down\" from American pretzels, with the thick body on the top and the twist at the bottom.\" [picture to illustrate](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/535c1783e4b0faf2733dd647/t/53b31234e4b01ed85bc17bce/1404244554110/IMG_0248.jpg?format=1500w). \n\nI'm not a fan of how the author simply glosses over this fact. Simply saying \"the fat side goes  up!\" isn't much of an explanation. But looking at other culinary trends, this certainly seems true.  A cursory Google image search for any croissant illustrates an overwhelming preference to depict the crescent with the nice soft, fat side up and the \"horns\" down. This same trend goes for any search of \"crescent bread.\"  \n\nWhat I find incredibly interesting is the WHEN that accompanies the WHY of this great American pretzel flip. I've scratched through a number of searches for old Pennsylvania Dutch (Deitsch or Deutsche... in case you didn't know... they aren't Dutch) recipes and artwork and found this beauty: [Picture](http://www.homemade-dessert-recipes.com/images/potato-cake-pretzel.gif) and [Recipe](http://www.homemade-dessert-recipes.com/potato-cake-recipe.html).  This recipe is dated 1915, and is called a pretzel cake! Most intriguing is that the accompanying picture features the European style fat-side-up orientation.  To go back even earlier, we can find that the first commercially successful pretzel factory in PA, the [Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery](http://www.juliussturgis.com) (founded 1861!) features the European pretzel in it's logo to this day.  Another tid bit worth mentioning is that Americans seemed crazy about hard pretzels, certainly far more than their European counterparts. I'd have to research more to be 100% sure of this, but there is certainly a well supported trend within American culinary tradition of favoring foods that travel well across long distances and are more shelf stable.  The traditional European *brezeln* was a fresh baked, daily purchase. Like with almost every other culinary element (fresh fish, fresh dairy, fresh bread...) the compact nature of European towns favored the soft, loafy brezeln, and the wide open spaces of American farm land favored the shelf stable hard pretzel.  It also made economic sense: a bakery can only sell fresh goods in its small town, a factory can sell shelf stable pretzels across the country.  A hard pretzel requires uniformity of width throughout the twist so that nothing burns in an extended baking or drying process. **[SEE EDIT]** It's my conclusion that this contributed to the American aesthetic of the uniform pretzel.  So much so that it eclipsed even the traditional soft pretzel, which eventually adapted the uniform width.\n\nSo it seems that at some point in the late 1800's or early 1900's, with the pretzel moving toward it's modern American form, the chubby-side-up/horns down aesthetic just stops working. The new American pretzel looks better with its two arches pointed up. Also, if a pretzel is being sold from a cart or hung in a shop window, it's much easier to load them onto sticks or hooks through the larger holes up top; hanging at a playful angle, arches up.  The largest hole of the German style pretzel, is not the small \"ears\" but the center, and would most likely have hung in shop windows thusly.  \n\nThis is all conjecture! But it was fun. Thanks for the great topic. Hope someone else weighs in.\n\n*EDIT*: There's been a ton of great discussion in this thread.  The big correction I need to make is thanks to u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt who points out that the difference in width of the pretzel is much more likely a result of the type of dough used; Stiff dough for hard pretzels that, once rolled, carries its weight during the lift and twist motion vs. soft, enriched dough used for soft pretzels that tends to pull and sag.  Additionally, the whole hanging pretzel posit, which I felt so sure of last night, seems to be completely false.  Google \"hanging brezel\" and it looks like they're still hung from their little ears."}

And that leaves bits that can be used for the stocks and sauces. They also have time and equipment to do large batches, and reduce those down, and then add more stock, and reduce it down even more.\n\nSee also Alex French Guy here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3bwYFu\\_p7k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3bwYFu_p7k)\n\nYou mentioned a tomato sauce. Have a look at this: Spaghetti with tomato sauce: original Tuscan style vs. gourmet with Cristiano Tomei - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27aAsz9XwxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27aAsz9XwxM)\n\nHe makes two sauces.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Robuchon's Mashed Potatoes: I understand the how, but i'm here for the why [/INST] 1) This seems like an old school french method for cooking potatoes.  I've read a couple of articles that say various things - it keeps the flavor in, it keeps the nutrients in, it keeps the starches in, etc - but no actual science (from those sites).  Interestingly enough, I looked up the nutritional data for [potatoes cooked with the skin on](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2556/0) and [potatoes cooked with the skin off](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2558/0) and (according to them) skin on potatoes had slightly more of everything - carbs, protein, vitamins, etc so there might be something to having more flavor.\n\n2) The butter, as others have said, is done cold to help with the emulsion.  The idea according to Cooks Illustrated, is that cold butter melts slower and it gives you more time to whisk the fat into smaller droplets that will create a better emulsion.  Warm butter melts too fast for you to break the fat up into small droplets.  \n\n3) This one, while it sound silly and finicky (and it is).  [It does actually serve a bit of a purpose](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/11461-how-to-prevent-hot-milk-from-sticking-to-the-pan).  Milk when poured into a pan and heated will create a thin film where ever the milk touches the pan. A little bit of water in the pan first stops this from happening.  Will this have any effect at all on dish?  No.  Will it help you clean up some?  Yup.  Is this probably something he was told to do when he started cooking and just kept doing because that's the way he was taught?  It's hard to say, but probably."}
{"text":"<s> [INST] How do restaurants work? [/INST] Restaurants in their current form work that way because of what is called a \"brigade system\". A chef named Escoffier was the first one to think of this idea. Before his time, and really before modern restaurants, chefs would be hired to come to a house and they would attempt to prepare entire meals on their own, often getting in each others way, and causing a general clusterfuck that didn't lend itself towards efficiency. The idea of a brigade is instead of having multiple chefs working on multiple meals, you have multiple chefs each responsable for one portion of the meal.\n\nThis gives you the common positions in the kitchen...I won't get too into details, but in general, you have a grill guy that's charged with handling most of the proteins. Theres a sauce guy, he handles all the sauces, soups and hot recipes. There's a salad guy, he handles all the cold prep and salads. There's the guy whose job it is to get all the other chefs to put the stuff together at the right time. This is a horrible generalization, and there is a lot of variation in the system, but I think this gives you an idea.\n\nSo your food comes out in 30 minutes simply because of efficient flowthrough, developed from years of experience.\n\nLet's look at flowthrough....as soon as your server walks away from your table, communication starts. If there is to be salad or appetizers, this is communicated first, so that it reaches your table first...but let's focus on the entree...you ordered Grilled Chicken with a Cheese sauce, fried potatoes, and steamed asparagus with Hollandaise sauce.\n\nThe first step starts when the ticket is received...usually there is one chef that will look at the ticket and communicate the various needs down the line. The first instruction would be to the grill guy to fire (start cooking) the chicken.\n\nNext would be instructions to set (to make ready to cook) various items, like your vegetables and fried potatoes made to the various chefs responsable for those items.\n\nHe would also let the sauce guy to go ahead and get one order of cheese sauce ready. This cheese sauce was made earlier in the day, and only requires heating. The Hollandaise sauce is probably a make to order item, so the sauce guy will begin working on that.\n\nAs the chicken gets close to being done, the other items will begin to finish, with the timing being defined by communication and experience. The chef will get the chicken from the meat guy, the veggies from the veggie guy, the fried potatoes from the fry guy, the sauces from the sauce guy, and put the dish together and make it ready for sale.\n\nThis process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes depending on how involved the recipes are, and the millions of differences in quality of restaurants; i.e. a cheap bar and grill is probably just opening a can of cheese sauce for your chicken dinner, while a fancier place may be making your cheese sauce to order, and those two things take very different amounts of time.\n\nThe secret to the brigade system is simple. First, having your ingredients in place. That's prep...if you use sliced onions in your dishes, you don't slice an onion every time you need one, you slice a bunch ahead of time. Some foods are precooked, but not as many as you'd think...bacon is a big one that's done ahead of time, and almost nowhere will half-cook food, as that affects both safety and quality of most foods. There are some exceptions. Second, communication and teamwork help the system move along, being able to process multiple plates at the same time. The average grill guy that we used in this example could have as many as 50+ items on the grill at one time, depending on how busy it is.\n\nSorry so wordy, I love the business! And remember those guys next time...your server is the face you get to meet, but if you really enjoyed the food, ask your server if you can buy the guys in the kitchen a beer...not everywhere allows it, but that's a thing, and they'll appreciate it!"}

If so, for how long?\n\nYes, once established (when it consistently doubles or more within 4-6 hours after feeding) you can put it in the fridge. You can feed it once every 1-2 weeks without issues. I take it out the day before I want to bake with it and feed it twice before baking.\n\n>Can I use my sour dough starter in most bread recipes, or is it mostly centered around sour dough bread?\n\nYou can, but proofing times will be doubled or more for certain things, depending on how much of the starter you use in the dough. When you are first getting started I recommend you follow recipes that use starter until have a good understanding for how long your starter takes to proof various types of dough. During this time, you should learn about what changing the ratios in your starter achieves, and how different temperatures change proofing times. These are very important when working with sourdough. \n\nWith pizza specifically, heat is the main source of leavening, so anything that builds some gas bubbles in the dough will work, then the heat expands the bubbles that are present. Long, cold fermentations work quite well for sourdough pizza. \n\nOverproofing occurs when the ethanol byproduct of the starter breaks down the gluten network in the dough. A low ratio starter and a high percentage of starter in the dough will hasten proofing times. Conversely, a high ratio starter and a low percentage of starter in the dough will slow proofing times. \n\n/r/Sourdough \n\n/r/Breadit \n\n/r/Pizza\n\nEdit: This is a good place to start: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe\n\nThey also have several troubleshooting blogs, and a collection of recipes that use discard, and many other sourdough recipes."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] How do restaurants cut vegetables? [/INST] This depends greatly on the restaurant. Big chains often times order in the ingredients pre-cut by machines.\n\nFor a more upscale restaurant, they have prep cooks that work in the AM. Their sole job is to do all the prep before the chefs do their work at night.\n\nSo I recommend the day before, do as much chopping as you can, or grab a friend to help if they have skills or can follow instructions well. Chop all veggies and prep any ingredients ahead that you can.  Like sauces...often times a sauce you can make in a big batch a day ahead (and can actually taste better too!). Pasta can be cooked al dente and be stored (coat pasta in a small amount of sauce to keep from sticking).\n\nAnd write down EVERYTHING. List each dish & side. Then list for each dish what needs to be prepped.\n\nFrom there, group like items. So if you need carrots for 2 different dishes, cut all the carrots at one time. You can then either store the cut carrots together (assuming you need the same shape and size cut for both dishes) or for ease of final cooking day, go ahead and portion it out. So when you go to mix in the salad ingredients, you are just grabbing bags or bowls of pre-measured ingredients.\n\nThis preserves your thinking power for the big day."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] How to Create an Aftertaste and Layers in General [/INST] First of all, let's define \"aftertaste\". This is just the taste that lingers on your tongue after all of the aromatic compounds have been sensed and all of the other taste compounds have been washed away/swallowed. We also have to make the distinction between aroma and taste. Aroma is what  you sense with your nose, and taste is what you sense with your tongue. Aroma is what makes a strawberry taste like a strawberry and not a raspberry, while taste is saltiness, acidity, sweetness, bitterness and umami. Aroma without taste is equivalent to smelling something, while taste without aroma is what you get when you have a cold and \"cannot taste anything\". Flavor is not specifically defined, but I generally use it as the overall sensation you get combining aroma and taste.\n\nAs for what gives an aftertaste. That is generally up to what taste compounds you have left on your tongue. More often than not the aftertaste is the prevailing overall taste compound of the food that becomes more apparent after the main flavor profile as the aroma isn't there to distract you anymore. Another way an aftertaste can present itself is if there is a fat soluble compound that isn't rinsed away as easily by your saliva, as most acidic, sweet, and salty compounds are. Especially bitter ones can be in the latter category, which is why this is more often considered an aftertaste (also because we generally think bitterness tastes bad).\n\nSo what can you do about this? Well, either you can dilute it (keeping in mind if it is water soluble or fat soluble), or you can balance it with other flavor compounds so it doesn't stand out but instead works together to form a more cohesive flavor. Diluting is easy, balancing is hard and requires some experience (but practice makes perfect).\n\nFor bitterness in general, all other tastes balances it out to some degree, but umami and acidity are particularly good for this (in my opinion).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To add on some more comments: Prolonged cooking can also alter a lot of these compounds. Some are more stable than other. For example, you can boil salt water for ages and nothing would happen with the saltiness (except for evaporation of the water), while more complex taste compounds will break down and possibly change the perception your tongue has to it. How much they can break down and how big of an impact it can have, I cannot entirely say, I'd have to leave that to an organic chemist to answer."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Who do I always get a large tendon in my homemade drumsticks but not in prepared cooked chicken? [/INST] You have to cook chicken leg so the collagen in the tendon breaks down into gelatin. People worry about over cooking chicken but that tendon will only start to break down at 160* F and it needs to stay at that temp, but not to far above (which will dry it out in a long cook) for it to continue breaking down. With fried or grilled chicken because of the temperature the collagen will breakdown quickly but with oven roasting or rotisserie the breakdown of the collagen into gelatin takes longer. So I would guess you might not be cooking your legs for long enough to dissolve that tendon, even though you may be pulling them once they reach 165* F."}
{"text":"<s> [INST] Stir-frying contradicts a lot I've learned about cooking so far [/INST] Firstly, stir-frying at home is distinctly different from wok-style cooking with those large burners. The former is a home method of one-pot recipies. The latter is almost only available to special kitchens.\n\nI wouldn't say Chinese wok cooking (or any stir fry) tries to get oil \"smoking.\" The wok is heated dry - without oil, and then oil is added at the last second right before cooking. This both allows for a quick non-stick surface, and prevents oil from smoking. However, in general, home stir fry style cooks food in small pieces, so there isn't as much time to let it sit and brown, so you'd like as high temp for a little time. You want the oil hot - shimmering so wooden chopsticks tips start to bubble when dipped in is a good metric - but not smoking. These temps are far below the temp of non-stick coating breakdown.\n\nDuring cooking, oil is \"stir fried\" quickly with a lot of mixing to get air incorporation. Ideally, it also gets a bit burnt from the live fire, giving it a singed flavor much like dripping fat onto charcoal gives that distinctive cookout flavor.\n\nLastly, aromatics are not universal. Sometimes you add them in the beginning if you want to build flavor; sometimes you add them at the end as garnish. Same with starting by sauteeing onions or adding parsley at the end as garnish. Generally, tougher more root-like aromatics serve as better to cook in the oil in the beginning, like ginger or garlic, whereas 'greener' aromatics like basil or green onions should go in at the end. Exceptions exist - maybe you want a pungent garlic flavor with minced stuff at the end. Again, there is no absolute rule for cooking from an entire culture , just as there isn't an absolute rule for Western cuisines. \n\nFor you example of Kenji vs Ramsay, I'm assuming this is fried rice recipies? Take a note on the size of the meats they're adding. I would wager Kenji is adding ground beef, while Ramsay may be adding bigger cuts. The principles of cooking in general still apply.\n\nJust keep cooking to get a sense. Some chefs like Gordon Ramsay have to consider what British cooks have in their kitchen, and thus may deviate from 'authentic' if it just means more people will branch out, which is never wrong. I recommend following recipies to the letter the first time to try to get a sense of the goal, then adapting it the second time based on your experience/experiments."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Ruined a large batch of fried shallots.....what did I do wrong? [/INST] Malaysian restaurant line cook here!\n\nStart with warm but not hot oil. Add your shallots and bring them to a rolling boil. Keep the heat relatively high until the shallots cross that threshold where they're dehydrated enough that they no longer boil and begin to get shiny on top. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir frequently. The closer they get to being finished the more stirring they will require. During the final 2 minutes or so they need to be stirred constantly. Picking the exact right moment to remove them can be tricky and takes practice. Keep in mind that they will continue to darken for a minute after they're out of the oil. Pull them when they're 1.5-2 shades lighter than the final product. They won't become crispy until they have cooled to room temperature.\n\nAlways have your paper towel lined sheet tray and spider ready well in advance. When they're done they're done and you have to be ready. The difference between perfect and burnt is about 10 seconds. Fluff with chopsticks immediately after they come out.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Is uncured Pancetta just straight up pork belly?

There is no single 'best method' if that's what you're after. You need to consider what result you're hoping to achieve and the best method to get there. Flavour is not a single attribute that you have more or less of, it is a whole range of different attributes, and by treating the same ingredients in different ways you can create a range of different flavours.\n\nA mirepoix doesn't contain garlic, and you cook all three vegetables slowly together, without browning, because you're not looking for a caramelised flavour, you are looking for the first layer of layered flavours. There is (obviously) nothing wrong with caramelising, but it's not the right thing for every recipe. \n\nWhat you describe sounds more like a stir-fry, and if that's the case, and you want all elements to have the same degree of doneness, then you need to add them in reverse order of cooking time so that they all finish at the same time.

This type of mineral oil is a transparent, colorless oil, composed mainly of alkanes and cycloalkanes, related to petroleum jelly. It has a density of around 0.8–0.87 g/cm3 (0.029–0.031 lb/cu in).\n\nDue to their susceptibility to oxidation from the exposure to oxygen, heat and light, resulting in the formation of oxidation products, such as peroxides and hydroperoxides, plant oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have a limited shelf-life.\n\nPresumably a wooden cutting board?

Easy to source if you're by an Asian grocery store, cook according to package directions.\n* Grated carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, romaine lettuce = probably fresh veggies as described, sliced thinly or julienned.

Is it strictly/traditionally Vietnamese? Purists would say no. But really, Vietnamese food & cooking has been indelibly shaped by its links to French & Chinese occupation, and its culinary tradition is further complicated by the diaspora. All this to say: honor \"roots\"/\"tradition\" when you can, but recognize these things are always in transition/negotiation/adaptation based on real lived experience by the Viet community settling in a variety of different places. \"Authenticity\" is both a myth and static constraint, IMHO.

{"text":"<s> [INST] When tempering chocolate, why do we raise the temperature above the temper temperature before cooling it down and bringing back up? [/INST] Cocoa butter is made up of 3 fat molecules that each have a different melt point. When CB cools, you need those molecules to form beta crystals. You achieve that with movement and agitation. Manufacturers want the chocolate heated to a point that all of the CB is melted as you can't form beta crystals with only 2 melted molecules so they recommend a high starting temp. The higher temp you heat to, the longer it takes you to cool it down so I melt it to just above 100F (38C) and stir it until it falls to 92F (33C) and then use it. The thing about beta crystals is they're like the cool kids in high school. Once other molecules see how to line up and form betas, they follow suit and make more beta crystals and over crystallize your chocolate which is why it gets so thick event though it's the same temp as earlier. Hope all that makes sense."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Is MSG as bad as people say? [/INST] MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, which is naturally found in cheeses, tomatoes, fish sauce, etc. Glutamic acid is the molecule that gives us the sensation of \"savoriness\" or umami. As one might expect, this flavor (and thus molecule) is found in most cuisines, though the origin may differ.\n\nThere is not any high quality evidence that MSG has any adverse effect on humans*, see [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8282275), for example.  The idea that MSG can cause negative effects likely originated with a letter (not peer-reviewed research) to a journal about \"Chinese restaurant syndrome.\" The idea likely stayed alive by a combination of the placebo effect and mild fears about cuisines seen as \"foreign\" (at least in the US).\n\nCulinarily, MSG can be a bit unsubtle. MSG by itself is a pure savoriness, so it can be easier to overdo than adding too much cheese or soy sauce to a dish. However, when used well, it can really amp up the flavor of the dish.\n\nEdit: People are correctly pointing out that glutamic acid is a non-essential amino acid (and most common neurotransmitter), meaning not only does it naturally occur in your body, you can produce it by yourself.\n\n*Additionally, there's at least one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766026?dopt=Abstract) suggesting that MSG might increase IBS in fibromyalgia patients who have IBS, but it's a pretty small study."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Butter is expensive in my country, is it possible to make puff pastry with margarine instead? [/INST] Someone with more experience might correct me, but I believe the reason butter works in puff pastry is that its water content turns to steam in the oven, creating separation in the dough layers. Margarine is pure fat so might not work. Further, butter can be beaten into thin blocks (which are folded into the pastry dough). Margarine is usually spreadable and not mouldable, so it might be tricky to achieve the 'puff' texture.\n\nThat said, I've read that you can make shortcrust type pastry with oil only. I haven't tried it but there are [recipes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/easy-oil-pie-crust-recipe-304979) out there with good reviews. Maybe these could be an acceptable substitute? Homemade phyllo is another option though it is a ton of work.\n\n> Also, if you have any ideas for what I can use to substitute the following I would appreciate it;\nCream cheese, cream of tartar, lard, buttermilk.\n\nCream cheese: depends on what you're making, but if you strain yoghurt overnight it gets thick and creamy. Doesn't have the same fat content as cream cheese so this might not work in baking.\n\nButtermilk: yoghurt beaten with enough water to make it a thick pourable liquid. Or, for some baking applications, milk mixed with a spoon of lemon juice/vinegar and let stand for fifteen minutes.\n\nLard: you can render this out of meat, there are tutorials online.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Does rubbing spices on a potato before throwing it on a pan add flavor or just burn them? [/INST] I've experimented this with a lot and I disagree with the top comment here. Toasting spices takes a few seconds - you lose so much of the flavor as you keep cooking them after that. I used to season the crap out of my potatoes early on but realized they always ended up tasting so monotone. The heat flattens everything out in my opinion. \n\n\nNow, I sautee the potatoes on high heat with lots of oil or butter and get them super crisp first. Then i remove them, add some olive oil and the spices, let them bloom for a bit, and then toss the potatoes back in and toss in the flavored oil. The flavors are pronounced, fresh, and at their best this way. Kenji does something very similar with his roast potato recipe.\n\n\nI do find that if you're cooking on low to medium heat or if your goal is to meld flavors together like a stew or curry then the long cook time is fine. But even in these cases I tend to add a few fresh spices here and there towards the end of the cook to layer flavors. \n\n\nGarlic is one of the spices that most commonly suffers from long cooks destroying the flavor. You know how some people claim that they have to triple or guadruple the garlic cuz they love garlic sooooooo much? Yeah, no lol. Try adding a few cloves fresh right at the end and you'll see what a dish tastes like when the original garlic flavor is preserved."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why does adding blue food coloring make whipped cream/meringues \"whiter\"? [/INST] It has to do with color theory. Typically, if you want to neutralize one color, you would use the opposing color as seen on a color wheel.

This results in a whiter or brighter whipped cream/meringues."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Learn to taste [/INST] 1. You have to start by differentiation between taste and aroma. Taste is only salt, acid, umami, bitter and sweet. Aroma is thousands upon thousands of different nuances. It is what makes a strawberry \"taste\" like strawberry instead of an indistinguishable blob of sweetness and acidity. Taste is the backbone of flavor, and then you build upon it with aromas to make a complete flavor profile. Taste without aroma is what you get when you have a cold and \"can't taste\" anything. Aroma without flavor is what you get when you make something and it tastes \"bland\". Identifying what of these two problems you have is the absolute number 1 skill to learn if you want to be able to \"taste\".  \nSo in your question you ask \"When do I add salt, and when pepper\". Here is a main problem. Salt brings a lot in taste, but nothing in aroma, while pepper is heavily aromatic, but basically nothing in taste (apart from the spicy element).  \nMy advice is to try and distinguish the taste profile of food you enjoy and think about how to balance salt, acid, sweetness, umami and bitterness. A hint is that acid and sweetness balances each other, and salt and umami balances each other. Bitterness often lightens up a dish when low, and can be balanced by all of the others. After you have an idea on how to balance taste, you can start with adding aromas to this.\n2. Try to break down the sauce. First the taste and then the aroma. What can you sense, how is it built? The reason it is tasty is probably mainly the balance of taste, and the aromatics just make it extra interesting. But if you can make a sauce with the same balance it will still be good to you, even if the aromatics aren't on point.\n3. To become better you mainly have to think about the flavor of the things you eat. Why is it good? What is good about it? What drives the flavor profile of this dish?"}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Why do chefs hate pressed garlic?

I've been through a bunch of them ranging from cheap to expensive and in the end every single one broke or became uncleanable (looking at you - die cast aluminum). \n\nI'm not actually certain that a knife is faster or more efficient to *use* than a press, but if you factor in cleaning time and that it's just going to break, a knife is a lot better overall.

{"text":"<s> [INST] How do I make a well/well done ribeye steak, good? [/INST] There are two main beef proteins affected by cooking, myosin and actin.  Myosin denatures at 104-122F and actin denatures at 150-163F.  When actin denatures, it contracts and becomes very firm, squeezing out moisture and fat.  The actin is most responsible for the toughness of well done meat.\n\nBeef is well done at an internal temperature of 155F, but the myoglobin responsible for the red color denatures and turns color at 140F.  At 140F beef loses 6% of it's moisture, and at 160F it loses 18%.\n\nGiven all that info above, the trick to a tender well-done steak is to raise the internal temperature above 140, denaturing the myoglobin, without reaching the 150F that causes the actin to denature.  140F will still be red, but 145 will lose the redness.  A steak pulled at 145 will continue to transfer heat to the core, raising internal temp by another 5F, to 150F.\n\nIn other words, you need a good thermometer and you need to pull the meat off the heat at exactly 145F internal temperature and then let it rest.  The additional resting time also allows more collagen to denature, becoming gelatin, which adds to the moisture and counters toughness."}

Also when elaborate table settings came into vogue and why people now eat with cutlery from the outside in. Still piling crap onto a plate, but with charger plates. As Michelin rose to prominence, French food became even more codified post Larousse and at the time was very sauce forward and more about shining a light on the protein. A great deep dive in to Michelin food universe which describes a lot of the plating concepts is [The Perfectionist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000P46S0C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) about Bernard Loiseau.

Then proceed to add the rest of coconut milk \n2. If you want to go the extra mile, you could make your own coconut milk. Buy fresh (old) coconut, shred the flesh, put it in cheesecloth, squeeze it (no water added). That's the richest milk you'll get without reducing it to cream.  We call this the 'head' of the coconut milk. You use this part at the beginning of cooking ie rendering the fat per my instruction above. Now you would have shredded coconut that has been previously squeezed. Don't throw it out. Add about 1/2 cup of warm water, wrap it in cheesecloth again. This is the 'tail' of the milk, add this part as a broth for the curry. \n3. Sometimes you could find frozen shredded coconut from an Asian grocery store.

[/INST] If you want a challenge, try tackling all the various doughs for Chinese buns and dumpling wrappers.\n\nWhen I first looked into it, I was shocked at how much variation there is. The main variation is the temperature of the water and the percentage of hydration, which was surprising to me. A hot water dough is not going to behave the same as a warm water dough or a cold water dough, and blending half hot and half cold or any combination of the three in various proportions and at various hydration levels gives different outcomes. The heat does something to the proteins and the starches which I don't understand, and these effects can be exploited to fine-tune the effects you want to see in your dough, whether leavened for a bao style bun, or unleavened for dumpling wrappers, scallion flatbreads, and other Chinese pastries.\n\nYou can get dumpling wrappers that are springy, chewy, soft, flakey, brittle, stretchy, not stretchy, and all sorts of variations on texture by manipulating the temperature of the water you use to hydrate the flour. Then you can start using flour with different levels of gluten, and start messing with the alkalinity of the water, for another year of experimentation and learning.\n\nHere's the two variables of hydration and temperature, and the applications of each that I was able to observe from the videos (not complete):\n\n|Water variables|*Low hydration*|*Mid Hydration*|*High hydration*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|*Hot (> 70˚C)*|Chinese 'tortillas',  tender shumai wrappers|Crispy skin potsticker wrappers,|Crispy spring roll skins,|\n|*Warm (70˚>T >30˚)*|Flakey scallion flatbreads|Flakey and somewhat chewy thin layered dough thing.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Is there a resource you’d recommend to improve my plating from home cook to better-than-home-cook? Also, how many random plates do you own? [/INST] Apologies as this is a bit of a re-post as I have written about plating around here a number of times before. \n\nPlating tends to be trendy and publishers don't really like to address topics that aren't going to keep selling, so there are few written resources.  And the market for info on plating is 99% chefs and we all learn on the job. \n\nBut I have accumulated a lot of plating fundamentals over the years from working for a succession of French Master chefs that I am happy to share. \n\nThe main concepts are: Colour, contrast, construction, and composition.\n\n* No brown on brown or white on white. Use elements that are [different colours](https://imgur.com/05Xtkop) but don't use more than three or four or the plate will get busy. Use colours that are [complimentary.](https://imgur.com/jm7PsbA) You kind of have to pick your shots, mushroom sauce is never gonna be the prettiest kid at the prom. There are ways to work monochrome but its not a personal favourite of mine.\n\n* Each component should be [distinguishable from its companions.](https://imgur.com/iFxtzUN) A pureé, a sauce and a pile of beans might taste great but aren't going to be pretty when splashed together. Lord knows I love me a plate of cheese enchiladas with refried beans and rice, but even as a chef I'd be hard pressed to make that plate look like anything other than delicious slop.\n\n* Mashed potatoes are freaking delicious but dumped on a plate, aren't going to look good. Use a piping bag or [a ring mold](https://imgur.com/KGtnSp3) to provide form and construction to un-formed elements. Likewise, potatoes au gratin are the bomb, but a scoop of them is gonna look garbage. A portioned [block of dauphinoise](https://imgur.com/rlSP58E) or a fondant is going to be more elegant. Uniformity of shape and size is [pleasing to the eye](https://imgur.com/DkJYThq). And don't sleep on the [humble hasselback](https://imgur.com/ZR20TCE) for an easy but pretty potato.\n\n* Work from the ground up. Pureé on the bottom, protein on top, veg under/to the side, garnish strategically. [Elements should touch,](https://imgur.com/cR0juZ1) not be placed separately about the plate. Consider what side of the dish is going to be placed in front of the person eating. No one wants the back end of a piece of chicken, you want that [golden skin to be right up in their face.](https://imgur.com/3T3VCAa)\n\n* If you want to get a fancy, invest in [squeeze bottles to place dots of sauce,](https://imgur.com/5lPszRJ) learn how to [strategically drizzle things,](https://imgur.com/oYR51RA) how to use a spoon to make [the perfect rocher. ](https://imgur.com/mZqKUwo) They're getting a wee bit cliché these days, but a few microgreens can go a long way to dress things up, [mix of textures, elements and colours are your building blocks](https://imgur.com/ESSjy0R)- add in nasturtiums, wafer thin mandolined radish and cucumber, citrus supremes and fluid gels and now you've dressed up boring old crab salad. Also, think about the serving vessel- got some pudding you want to serve? Layer it in [a stemless wine glass, instant fancy.](https://imgur.com/8C6Nalp)\n\n* When it comes to the actual plates, most restaurants don't have a huge variety of them simply due to cost. Worked for a chef who would shout every time someone broke a plate:  \"Now I gotta sell 20 fucking cheeseburgers to pay for that fuck up.\"  What you see on fancy social media are often one offs or sponsored. But when it comes to selecting shape/style, often its about contrasting [the round against the linear](https://imgur.com/Nyb0vz2) or centralising a dish [within negative space.](https://imgur.com/RbtNIdo) In a restaurant setting its more about designing the dish to go with the plates you already have in inventory rather than the other way around.\n\nTo learn more, follow chefs on IG whose work you find attractive."}
{"text":"<s> [INST] Why do so many things float when they're cooked? [/INST] For most starch based things, cooked (gelatinized) starch can only hold onto 2 water molecules whereas uncooked starch can hold onto four water molecules. So, starch gets hydrated with four molecules of water, then when it gets gelatinized, two of those molecules get released. Because gelatinized starch creates a nearly watertight network, the extra water gets converted to steam, but is trapped so things float. For meats, a similar thing happens, but it's the tightening of the meat protein matrix that squeezes excess water out, and some gets trapped inside and converts to steam."}

Then make sure your broiler is on if you have been using the standard bake at high heat. Keep an eye on the egg and take it out as soon as the whites set. You should be able to tell when the white sets by giving the pizza a little jiggle. The yolk should still move while the whites are almost completely firm (keep in mind it will cook a bit once you take it out, so if the whites are completely firm in the oven, you likely wont have a super runny yolk)."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Weekly discussion: Authenticity in food [/INST] Of course in a basic sense if the food you make is tasty then nothing else matters. This includes authenticity and anything else. So, that's my initial response.\n\nBut I do think there are reasons to care about authenticity. In a lot of contexts, people have not been exposed to a wide variety of tastes. They've grown up eating the food of one culture and even when they've had food from other cultures it's actually just another kind of food from their culture, albeit with influences from another culture. \"Chinese\" food in America and India is a good example. American \"Chinese\" food and Indian \"Chinese\" food is not much like most food from China (aka \"authentic\" Chinese food). That's not to say it's bad - it's merely different - but it's definitely not as new or innovative to someone who has grown up in America or India as a lot of actual Chinese food would be.\n\nSo, one reason to insist on authenticity, and on cooking Chinese food like they cook in China, is because this will expose you to new flavors, ingredients, techniques, and combinations. I think it's always good to expand your palate. Insisting on authenticity isn't the *only* way to do this - you could after all just buy a bunch of stuff you've never eaten and try making your own stuff - but it is a *huge* shortcut, since (for instance) China has already figured out tasty things to do with ya cai or doubanjiang or fermented tofu and you can cook those recipes to learn what these things taste like and what you can do with them.\n\nAnother reason to worry about authenticity is bigotry. Speaking now just about America (which is where I'm from) a lot of people from non-American cultures face a lot of bigotry with respect to their authentic food. (The podcast Racist Sandwich has a lot of great discussion of this.) A child of immigrant parents who brings authentic Indian or Chinese food to school will often get taunted by the other children, ostracized, etc. Lots of Americans will refuse to eat at authentic \"ethnic\" restaurants because they're afraid the food will be too \"spicy\" or \"weird\" and a lot of that just stems from straight up xenophobia. This means people from these cultures are forced to \"water down\" their food to appeal to the dominant culture or face prejudice, and that's not fair at all. Insisting on the importance of authenticity helps combat this because it lends value to doing things the way people are inclined to do it, rather than forcing them to fit in to the restrictive tastes of many Americans.\n\nA related reason to worry about authenticity is cultural imperialism and cultural appropriation. A lot of \"Indian\" food in America is British Indian food, so much so that Americans who don't know anything about Indian food will sometimes get upset if they go to an Indian restaurant and they can't just get chicken tikka masala and butter chicken or things like this. So for instance a South Indian restaurant serving dal, sambhar, idlis, dosas, etc. would make some Americans upset and get pushback for not serving \"real\" Indian food like naan and curry. They'll get their menu explained to them by Americans who think they know what Indian food is, but who don't.\n\nIn fact this gets *really* bad for Indian food in particular for some reason, because a lot of Americans are convinced there are basically two kinds of food in India: tikka masala and curry, and they'll insist that all Indian food must fit into one category or another. This means people will label almost all Indian food \"curry\" (a more or less meaningless word) and refuse to accept any Indian food that doesn't match whatever weird definition of curry they have in their head, and everyone has a different one because the word is meaningless anyways. (It also leads to people using \"curry\" in various ways to insult Indian people, since \"curry\" is the one word they think of when they think of India. See [here](https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-the-politics-of-curry-97457). And it also leads to people putting curry powder in all their Indian food, which is ridiculous, because almost no Indian food is made with curry powder.)\n\nMy favorite example is [this recipe](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/10/chicken-curry/) from a well-meaning American. She made an Indian-inspired chicken recipe and called it tikka masala because she had vaguely heard of the various Indian chefs suggesting that calling everything \"curry\" is insensitive. When commenters pointed out it had sweet fuck all to do with tikka masala, she gave up and changed the name to curry, the only other Indian-ish word for food she has ever heard. If one focuses on learning about authentic food, one will not be the sort of person who gets angry at an Indian restaurant for not serving British food, or the sort of person who thinks all Indian food is either tikka masala or curry, and so on.\n\nFinally, in the American context, the taste of the broad American public is kind of... not amenable to a lot of people's tastes. Lots of America likes everything sweet and not very spiced or spicy. So when other culture's foods become American they gain a lot of sweetness and lose a lot of spices and heat. Ditto for losing out on fermented stuff (fermented tofu is a no-go for Americans) and other funky stuff. So, insisting on authenticity lets you avoid Americanized recipes which drop some of the coolest tasting stuff. Obviously if you're not in America this is maybe not a relevant consideration.\n\nNow, of course, there's not really such a thing as \"authentic\" since food changes all the time. But I think there's a pretty obvious difference between kung pao chicken in an American Chinese buffet and kung pao (or, gong bao) chicken in Sichuan. And so obviously when people talk about \"authentic\" food they're picking up on *something*."}

The only sure way to tell the heat is to cut a tiny bit off the tip and taste it.  As a general rule, I find that the great big ones have been fed and watered so much in growing that they are less likely to have full heat, so I select smaller ones when I can, but that increases your odds without making any guarantee.  I keep a little cayenne based chili vinegar and chili oil on hand to increase the heat while cooking without making a big shift in flavor when the japs are disappointing.  Also, if if the dish I am cooking will have diced japs as a table condiment, I will reserve the milder ones for that use and cook with the hotter ones.  Sliced serranos provide the spicier table condiment and are easily distinguished."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Butter in vanilla cupcakes vs. oil in chocolate cupcakes? [/INST] Notice that oil is liquid at room temperature, while butter is semi-solid. Oil provides more of a moist mouthfeel than butter in baked goods. However, oil is also flavourless (assuming a neutral oil of course), while butter has that rich flavour that is so important in cooking.\n\nVanilla cakes have a very subtle flavour, hence the flavour from butter is very important. On the other hand, chocolate overpowers the flavour of butter, so it's possible to substitute it out for oil for its moistness without noticing much loss of flavour. \n\nOutside of just the ingredients themselves, there's also the mixing methods. A butter-based cake is usually mixed by the creaming method, where the butter and sugar(s) are creamed together. This isn't simply to just combine the two ingredients, but also to create small air cells within the butter that will allow for additional leavening during baking. This process is known as \"mechanical leavening\", since you're creating leavening from mechanical mixing. Here's an [article](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/12/cookie-science-creaming-butter-sugar.html) from Stella Parks that goes further in-depth on how it works. \n\nIf oil is used instead of butter, then you won't get the leavening from the creaming process, so you end up with a denser product. This is probably why the oil-based batters you've had feel more like a muffin."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] I tried making Gordon Ramsay's Salted Caramel Popcorn, but it sticks to each other. Can someone help? (Link in description) [/INST] I used to make caramel corn at a restaurant. I would start with brown sugar and butter. Heat to 245F, take it off the heat then stir in baking soda. I would always make the popcorn after the caramel so it’s still hot. Pour the caramel in a big bowl then the popcorn and fold it with the biggest spatula we had. Basically the same as Ramsey. \n\nWhere we differ, I lay it on a baking sheet and bake it at 270F for 10 or so minutes. This brings it to the soft crack stage. Now here’s my trick that made my popcorn the best in the restaurant. Let it cool JUST until you can handle it without getting burned, I would recommend gloves for this, you really want it hot for this part. Use a cold metal bowl, doesn’t need to be ice cold, just colder than room temp, and dump it all into the bowl. The bigger the bowl the better. Gently toss the corn while breaking the prices apart. As the caramel cools from the bowl it harden and keep it from sticking together. If you do it right you’ll start to hear the dinging sound of something hard hitting the metal. If you don’t hear that then you didn’t bake it long enough. \n\nYou can store it in any old container with a lid. Should stay fresh for a few days. I’ve never had it last that long so not totally sure. \n\nStarting with sugar and butter should keep those crystals from forming. You can also use a little lemon juice, just a squirt. It’s acts as an interferon and keeps crystals from forming. You can also get really fancy and use a brush with some water and wipe down the edges of the pot by the caramel as you’re making it. This keeps crystals from falling into it and forming larger ones. \n\nTBH not sure why he didn’t say what temperature you should cook the caramel to. I had this conversation with the pastry chef at that restaurant. Some people were just winging it and it wasn’t coming out well because it needs to be pretty exact for the results we wanted. You can get candy thermometers pretty cheap. They also double as deep frying thermometers. If you’re into caramel and candy making - which rules by the way - it’s a tool you’re going to want. \n\nGood luck!"}

Saponins seem to play the biggest role, as was expected based on previous literature.\n\nYour question about what the emulsifier \"prefers\" is a little misguided since all emulsions by definition need a water and fat component. Adding the water first helps stabilize the emulsion by balancing the water-to-fat ratio.

I have burnt ghee, and that is so painful you are not likely to make that mistake twice. \n\nI let the butter cook long and slow. The solids get very brown (but not burnt), and the bubbling noise that occurs in the early stages of cooking is almost completely silent by the end. The noise ghee makes while cooking is due to water. \n\nMaybe 5 minutes before I know it will be done, I turn off the heat and let it continue cooking under its own heat. Then I ladle it through a clean white handkerchief into a clean, dry jar.\n\nI make about two pounds at a time because we go through it quickly (it's virtually the only cooking fat I use), but if you use it more slowly, you can keep it in the fridge during the summer, and take it out several hours before you need it. Ghee is clear when hot, but as it cools it becomes opaque. My ghee is always a beautiful, deep golden color, because the browning of the ghee solids is what gives the color and extra flavor to ghee. Good luck!  \n\n\nEDITED to add: I don't  deep-fry any more, but ghee is amazing for that. Back when I did deep fry, I would re-use the ghee a maximum of four times. When I had a bunch of old ghee accumulated, I washed it and made soap out of (mixed with olive pomace oil). The resulting soap looked and smelled faintly of parmesan cheese, but it was a great soap! Twenty years later, I still have a bunch of it left. The cheese smell disappeared when washing, and eventually faded away altogether from the remaining slab of soap.. \n\np.s.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Just hired at fancy restaurant; need advice [/INST] Learn how to work quietly. Like I never thought about how important closing drawers and cooler doors lightly helps the equipment, as well as the things inside (an absentminded lowboy door slamming shut can shake your sauce out of a container and spill around your lowboy over the rest of your mis en place).  And same with ovens, pots/pans, station mis en place, plates.... Basically if you're not supposed to make noise and are, you're increasing the risk of breaking or fucking something up.\n\nAlso, work from one container to another, with a trash container. Like, one bowl for mushrooms, one for trimming and discards, and one to place product in. Keep your cutting board clean except the current focus.\n\nFold your towels, stay clean. A folded towel is cleaner, more effective, takes up less room, etc.  And keep your station as clean and organized as you can. And line sweeps show a chef you don't want to lean when you don't have something to do, as well as you care about the cleanliness of his kitchen.\n\n\nSharpen your knives, and get nice ones. Show pride in what you're doing and what you use to do it. If someone has a dull ass Mercer or Shun that's been beaten to hell, I can assume they won't be caring much for whatever tasks those knives will be put to. NOTE this does not necessarily translate to knives make you better. I have indeed seen good knife work from terrible knives. So that's why I say sharpen your knives before you get a nice new set of Inox or Masamotos. Splurge after you learn to sharpen and maintain knives.\n\nStart reading cookbooks. Good ones, not Jaime Oliver's best 100 Fuck Ups or whatever. Phaidon is a fantastic publisher, with restaurants like Osteria Francescana and NoMa in their collection. But also, like just badass books about ingredients and tastes and butchering and yea. You'll learn to enjoy going through a cookbook and dissecting their creative processes and cooking methods. I suggest getting a copy of The French Laundry to begin with. Or Momofuku. Both are great starter books. The Fat Duck Cookbook is a much more advanced volume but it is oh so sweet. And maybe one day you can get a copy of elBulli or Modernist Cuisine when you've fallen in love with reading.\n\n\nStage around. If you don't know what staging (stah-j / stah -jing) is, it's basically a tryout or short intern at a restaurant traditionally used as an interview, but also as a way to get around some kitchens. It's a great way to spend a day off for workaholics like 90% of our industry. And a lot of restaurants will honor your time in their kitchen with a few dishes to taste their menu. And you get a feel for other kitchens, chefs, teams, cuisines, etc. AND you can network, set up more stages at better restaurants, set up future jobs and relationships within the industry.\n\nLastly, listen to everyone. That guy that's in the weeds every night and looks like a mess? Maybe what he tells you has some weight because he knows how he's messing up. Some of the best coaches were mediocre or even laughable players. A lot of the time everyone has sage wisdoms to share. When I train new cooks I usually try to help them beyond myself, so they start off as high off the ground as possible. If someone is giving you shit or calling you out, it's because they want to push you to be better. Take it in stride and be better, don't get offended. "}

So, if you're pulling at 165, you're going to be overcooked since 165 is already borderline dried out as is with a chicken breast.\n\nSecondly, 165 is the temperature you need to hit to instantly kill effectively all bacteria. Killing bacteria is a function of time and temp, though, so you don't actually need to hit insta-kill temperature. If you cook the chicken to 150 and keep it there or above for 3 minutes (remember, carryover cooking will cook it for another few minutes alone), you achieve the exact same amount of bacteria killing goodness as going to 165 for an instant."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Uh..how is it safe to use eggs in homemade mayo if we don't cook it? wont the eggs be still raw? [/INST] Raw eggs are not inherently unsafe. \n\nAll food safety regulation is simply about mitigating risk. Because honestly, nothing we eat is without risk of some kind.\n\nEggs can be infected by salmonella in one of two ways: First, bacteria can be passed from an infected hen to her eggs as they develop inside her. Chickens can be vaccinated against this to mitigate that type of risk. Second, it can grow on the outside of the shell after an egg is laid if it comes in contact with a hen’s poop that contains salmonella.\n\nIn the US, the USDA requires eggs sold for consumption to be washed, processed, and then refrigerated. Washing them ensures that any salmonella that was present on the outside of the shells is removed. But- there's a trade off. Washing eggs removes the thin, filmy, protective outer layer called the cuticle. This cuticle is the natural shield that keeps bacteria out of an egg while letting oxygen circulate. \n\nOn the other hand, most European and Asian countries do the opposite and require that table eggs not be wet-washed, and also not refrigerated, because they still have their protective cuticle. Its thus recommended that non-washed eggs be washed immediately before consumption to remove any trace amounts of poop.\n\nBoth regulations were arrived at as effective ways to solve the same problem: reducing exposure to salmonella, a bacteria that causes unpleasant, though non-life-threatening, illness.  \n\nAdditionally, cooking isn't the only way to ensure food safety. Other ingredients like acid and salt in things like mayo and salad dressings help to create an environment that is less friendly to bacteria growth.\n\nIn the US, the CDC estimates Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year and that *most people recover without specific treatment.* Infants, adults aged 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.\n\nMost establishments will note on their menus any items that contain raw eggs so that people can make their own decisions whether or not to consume them."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Can anyone tell me what ingredient is creating this \"honeycomb\" texture in taro fried dumplings (Wu Gok) [/INST] OP your observations are pretty on point. Taro should be as starchy/\"sandy\" as possible.  Starchy taros are usually lighter since they have lower water content. The center of a taro usually have lower water content than its ends. (Wu Gok/芋角 are from Southern China, traditionally it's claimed that the taros from Lipu, China (荔芋) make the best Wu Gok)\n\nWheat starch. It's starch with little to no gluten and also the starch used in many other dim sums like the shrimp dumplings (Har Gao)  to provide strength and allow the Wu Gok to hold itself and puff\n\nTemperature of oil depends on which oil you choose, traditionally people use lard. But it's true that it won't honeycomb if the temperature is too high. To check your oil temperature you can always fry a small piece of wrapper first and see the results.  If the temperature is too low, the Wu Gok won't hold itself.\n\nEgg helps, but it's not necessary and not used in typical Wu Gok recipes.\n\nThe slang term people in dim sum industry used if your Wu Gok won't honeycomb is \"炸死\", literally means \"fried to death\". Some cheap-ass dim sum place don't even have Taro in Wu Gok, and it's common to add ammonia bicarbonate to help leavening."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Cooking for someone who can’t taste well after a stroke; I need super strong flavors and spices. NO Salt [/INST] First, because it is low hanging fruit, challenge the salt ban.  IIRC only 1 in 5 hypertensive folks are salt sensitive.  30 years ago when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure I got the full \"no salt\" lectures, including things like \"avoid celery; it is the highest sodium vegetable\".  I did a little research and met again with the nutritionist.  We did a series of tests over a month which demonstrated that unless I lived on beef jerky, ketchup, and dill pickles, sodium had no effect on my blood pressure.  The sodium myth has caused a lot of misery.  This [older article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/) is a pretty accessible introduction to the issue.  He will need to work with his doc and allied health professionals determine if he is in fact one of the minority who are salt sensitive, because if he is, it really matters.\n\nThat said \"taste\" is 2 things for most folks: flavors and basic tastes.  Flavors are things like basil and vanilla that we perceive as much through smell as through tongue contact.  Basic tastes are tongue centered: sweet, sour, bitter, spicy hot, salty and maybe umami (depending on who you ask).  Nerve damage from a stroke could affect either smell or tongue or both.  If he can taste sweet and spicy, but is getting no joy from the Mrs Dash stuff, I am guessing it is his nose tasting part that is at issue.  \n\nPending resolution of the salt impact issue, go for sweet, hot, bitter, sour and umami flavors to build his meals.  Keep in mind that visual cues affect our eating perceptions and that texture gives a great deal of pleasure even though it is not a flavor.  A spicy hot chili of your preferred style, with a quick pickle (sweet sour) coleslaw and a bitter chocolate mousse should be an enjoyable meal for him, if I am understanding your issue correctly.  Good foods to try for bitterness would be eggplant, bell peppers, most dark leafy stuff, grapefruit, asparagus. dark chocolate and coffee.  Spicy hot is pretty obvious as is sweet.  Sour is almost as much so, but buttermilk and other sour dairies might not occur to you right off the bat. Seafoods run toward umami flavors as do mushrooms, walnuts and sweet potatoes; a lot of the umami stuff is also heavily salted, so I will not list it until you sort out whether he is sodium sensitive.\n\nI would start by using the basic tastes and building menus from there.  I would also encourage his nerves to relearn how to perceive the smelled tastes by periodically offering a small amount of his past favorite dishes that rely primarily on flavors.  If he always loved oatmeal raisin cookies, make them.  The texture will be familiar and may help him reconnect to cinnamon and cloves (apple pie would work for this too).  Start with the earliest food memories you can work with, which tend to be sweet taste related.  Do not go too fast, maybe a nose flavor experience twice a week, heavy on the repeat of one flavor for several tries, but with subtly so he does not get depressed or anxious about whether he can taste basil.\n\nOther than the link on sodium sensitivity in hypertension, I haven't given you much documentation; I probably could give you more if you would like it and cannot google it easily.  However my real source is being 61 and having managed the care of a lot of aging family members and parishioners as well as doing companion work in hospice for several years.  I assume and pray that your father is years away from death, but active dying gives one a lot of immediate and intense hands on experience for slow process of simple aging.  Please feel free to ask me to clarify or document anything.  I am usually on-line in the evenings, though tomorrow night I am catering, so it will be spotty for me."}

[/INST] Big note, I’m fairly certain butter chicken in Europe is a classic example of BIR or British Indian Restaurant cuisine, and not tailored for the native Indian kitchens.\n\nIt’s a Punjabi dish, and is native to the subcontinent. Punjabi food is what most of us know outside of India as “Indian food” and was a way of using leftover tandoori chicken until it took off on its own. \n\nPunjabi food is typically spicy, and relies on thick well seasoned curries, and has some amazing mutton dishes. That said, it’s not all spicy. \n\nIndian cooking is several dozen unique and regional kitchens, not one overarching idea, and it’s rather reductionist to say 1.8B people all eat the same (much in the same way Americans think 1.8B Chinese people all eat “Chinese food” which is Americanized Cantonese cuisine).

{"text":"<s> [INST] Vegetarian and Vegan Culinary Resources [/INST] (part 1) Hey! I bake and cook a lot of vegan stuff. I generally just Google things to find out what I can use instead, but here is a rough guide to subbing ingredients, and other tips on vegan cooking.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to say that there are few vegan ingredients that can entirely replace animal ingredients in cooking, especially with ingredients where you rely on the chemical properties as opposed to the flavour. Hence, there are different suggestions for different cooking/baking scenarios.\n\nAlso, this guide will be exclusively for vegan cooking.\n\n# EGGS\n\nEggs are important in non vegan cooking since they provide stabilising proteins and tasty tasty fat, and are also a versatile standalone ingredient. Often they are used to give stability to cakes and cookies, or thicken sauces. Unfortunately, there are very few vegan substitutes that can play the role of an egg in every dish that they are put in. For example, tofu used for scramble won't be suitable in a cake. There are several egg replacements that can be used for different purposes:\n\n* Tofu. This is often used for scramble, flavoured with black salt, but it can work in pad Thai or Singapore noodles too.\n* Flaxseed. Commonly used in baking as a binding agent.\n* Boxed egg replacements, such as Orgran or Bob's Red Mill varieties. Used as binding agents in baking or very rarely in meringues.\n* [Aquafaba](http://aquafaba.com/faq.html). Leftover juice of cooked legumes, used to make Royal icing and meringue.\n* Applesauce. Often used alongside flaxseed jn baking to provide moisture.\n* Agar. Used to replace eggs when doing a clarification for consommé, or to make faux boiled eggs. A surprisingly useful ingredient for vegan chefs.\n* Black salt. Used for sulphurous flavour of eggs.\n\nThese are all the egg replacements I can think of. There are obviously more but these are the ones I have commonly used in my cooking.\n\n# DAIRY\n\nThis is a very vague category, so I will do. my best to split it up into sections.\n\n[The Non-Dairy Evolution Cookbook by Skye Michael Conroy](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Dairy-Evolution-Cookbook-Modernist-Plant-Based/dp/1499590423/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547506923&sr=8-1&keywords=non+dairy+evolution+cookbook) is an excellent resource on veganising dairy products. I will refer to it as the NDE in this section.\n\n# MILK\n\nMilk is another versatile ingredient. It is used either as a beverage or ingredient, and often in the latter, recipes rely on the chemistry of milk. Cow's milk is mainly made of sugars, water, and protein. Plant milk replacements may vary in what they are made of, but the nutritional content of various plant milks can be found [here](https://1y2u3hx8yml32svgcf0087imj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UACF-Milk-Varieties-Chart.jpg) (image credits to myfitnesspal).\n\nFor things that rely on the caramelisation of milk sugars, you should use plant milks that are high in sugar. And so is the case for milks that are high in fat, etc.\n\nGenerally, I will use oat, soy, or cashew milk for most applications. To me, they are the creamiest varieties of plant milk and those 3 tend to cover all bases for my culinary applications. Coconut milk is also very good in desserts and Asian savoury dishes.\n\nYou can make your own vegan milks but the results are much less consistent when using them as ingredients than buying the milk from the shop. Oat milk is tricky to use as a cooking ingredient for example because it becomes slimy when heated.\n\n# CHEESE\n\nCheese is a controversial subject in the vegan or nearly-vegan community. Again, with cheese, lots of the things we love about the dairy variety rely on the chemistry of cheese. The stretchiness and coagulation come from casein, a structural protein found in cheese. The sharpness and flavours come from microorganisms eating the sugars in the milk. The browning when cheese is baked is due to the maillard reaction from the proteins and sugars in the cheese.\n\nSo you will want to emulate those properties using various ingredients in your cheese. Some of the properties can be found easily in store bought products, for example vegan Parmesan is usually satisfactory for its purpose.\n\nPizza is something I missed when I went vegan. You can make decent vegan mozzarella using [this recipe](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/melty-stretchy-gooey-vegan-mozarella/), or there is a recipe listed in the NDE that is suitable. On that note, the NDE has plenty of recipes that make delicious vegan cheese. \n\n# YOGURT\n\nYogurt can usually be used in the same way as dairy yogurt. Many commercial varieties now exist and have a similar tangy flavour to dairy yogurt. If you're into fermentation, you can make your own; there is a recipe to do so in the NDE or [here](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/yogurt/how-to-make-non-dairy-yogurt/). You can still use vegan yogurt to add moisture to cakes and breads!\n\n# CREAM\n\nCream can usually be bought in the shops, yet lots of people decide to [make their own out of cashews](https://www.rebootwithjoe.com/savory-or-sweet-cashew-cream/), which is tasty. The shop bought cream is usually single soya cream, so it is suitable for using in cooking but not as whipping cream, since it has a low fat content. To make vegan whipped cream I follow [this](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/09/dairy-free-food-whipping-whipped-cream) recipe. Be cautious that some shop-bought soya cream may have added sugar, which might not be suitable for the application you want to use it for.\n\n# BUTTER\n\nOf all these ingredients, vegan butter is the one I cherish the most. I live in the UK, and I'm loyal to the brands Vitalite and Stork. Butter is incredibly important in both cooking and baking, because it has some wonderful flavour compounds and is responsible in aiding the lovely maillard reaction that gives us delicious browning on our food. \n\nWhen using vegan butter, you must be cautious that some margarine often has a higher water content than butter, which we don't necessarily want all the time. You can tell if this is the case by checking the calorie content, or the fat content. My vitalite has 500\\~ calories and 50g fat per 100g, whereas my stork baking block has 600\\~ calories and about 75g fat per 100g. Butter generally has about 700 calories and 81g fat content. \n\nMargarines with a higher water content can be useful for creating cakes that are less stodgy and glazing vegetables without using too much fat, however they should be avoided when baking pastries and cookies/biscuits. High fat margarines are preferred for the tastiest pastries since a lot of the properties we love about pastry come from the fat content of pastry.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider about vegan butter is the flavour of the butter itself. I like to use vitalite if I want the butter flavour to really shine through, hence why I use it in savoury applications such as glazing vegetables. If your margarine tastes of nothing, your food will be a little lacklustre. \n\n# \n\n# "}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Substituting vinegar for citrus: would you keep the quantities the same? Is lemon juice similar in acidity to apple cider vinegar, or do vinegars vary too much in their acidity to standardize this substitution? [/INST] In terms of Ph, lemon juice and vinegar are pretty similar, however, that doesn't mean they are perceived the same on the palate.\n\nVinegar is a fermented product and mostly acetic acid. It hits the palate in a completely different way. Commercially produced vinegar also doesn't have a lot of additional flavor. I'm talking about the stuff in the gallon jug from the grocery store, not the $12 bottle of balsamic finishing vinegar.\n\nBy comparison, lemon juice and citrus is is a natural fruit juice, and mostly citric and ascorbic acid. Different acids hit the palate differently. Think about how the acid from a green apple (malic) is different from citrus or vinegar. \n\nAnother consideration is, if the citrus is juiced in a way that expresses a lot of oil from the rind, like with a press, there is a lot of additional flavor added to the juice. Lime juice specifically can have a lot of vanilla flavors. This is the main caution I would give for substituting one for another. Verjus is probably the closest bridge between the two, but it's not as readily accessible and usually overpriced. \n\nWould you substitute lime juice in a guacamole for cider vinegar? Why or why not?

Chicken can be cooked to medium or even rare (though I wouldn't recommend that due to the texture) if you are careful enough with the temperatures - sous vide helps there.

{"text":"<s> [INST] Cinnamon buns in slow cooker were kind of terrible [/INST] Honestly, using a slow cooker. \n\nCinnamon buns are a baked food that’s normally cooked in a dry, relatively-high heat environment. By using a slow cooker, you’re cooking them in a wet, relatively low-heat environment instead. The dough is just going to react differently."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Can I use white unsalted butter instead of yellow unsalted butter in a cake mix ? [/INST] Color of the butter isn't related to the fat content. It's related to the cow's diet. White means it's low in beta-carotene. Yellow means it's high in beta-carotene.\n\nBeta-carotene comes from some grasses and flowers, or beta-carotene rich pasture. During summer, the butter tends to be more yellow as the cows are pasturing. During winter, it tends to be more white as the cows are fed grain.\n\nDepending on where you are in the world, you'll find brands adding food colouring to achieve the yellow color, as their cows never goes out to pasture at any point of the year."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] Baking question: Stollen recipe calls for 5-6 packets of active dry yeast... is this normal? [/INST] I just looked at the recipe an (Austrian) bakery I worked at uses and it calls for 120g fresh yeast for 1000g of flour. Which is about 40g of active dry or indeed 5-6 packets of 7g. That amount makes 6 regular sized Stollen.\n\nThis was a very traditional bakery, so it seems like the amount of yeast is indeed pretty traditional.\n\nThe issue I think is that Stollen is both a low hydration and high fat dough. This combination means that it needs a lot of yeast to rise properly. There is more butter than eggs and milk combined in the dough!"}

{"text":"<s> [INST] How does pasta made with all purpose flour differ from making it with pasta flour? [/INST] It depends on what kind of pasta you're making. Fresh pasta, like ravioli pasta or tagliatelle, works just fine with AP flour. Dried pastas made with AP flour tend to turn gummy when cooked due to the hydration of the starch, coming out more like dumplings in consistency than pasta. Extruded pastas like macaroni and spaghetti (which you can't even make at home without special equipment) really must be made with semolina flour. Dough made with softer flour won't even work in the extruder. It'll just squish.\n\nIf the only flours you have on hand are cake flour, AP flour and bread flour, use bread flour. If all you have is AP, use that to make fresh pasta, but be VERY careful about overcooking it. Just seconds too long in the water and it'll basically melt."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] “browning” ground beef [/INST] This is a great question.  More often than not, when we brown ground beef, we throw the chunk in the pan, and cook it until it's not pink.\n\nEssentially this is steaming the meat, as there's so much water being cooked out, and doesn't really make use of the maillard reaction.\n\n\nFor me, if I'm cooking the beef, I'll get the pan hot with some olive oil, and put the meat on it like a burger, and let it brown.  Flip it to the other side, and give that a sear and then chop it up to remove the pink.\n\nBut if I want to boost flavor, and have the time, I'll break up the meat into little clusters, almost like tiny burgers, and cook in batches.\n\n\nSo brown the meat can mean both, just depends on what you want."}

{"text":"<s> [INST] What's the best way to make spicy honey? [/INST] That's one way to do it, but I find that heating honey causes the flavor of the honey to change.

Then you can boil the alcohol off and stir the remaining extract into the honey."}
