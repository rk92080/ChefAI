Llama-ChefAI

"Chef AI" is a proof of concept that demonstrates the power of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for niche applications, specifically within the culinary domain. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Llama from Hugging Face and employing web scraping techniques, this project customizes an AI model using data from the top posts of the Reddit AskCulinary subreddit. By focusing on this rich source of culinary knowledge and discussions, "Chef AI" aims to provide tailored culinary advice, recipe suggestions, and cooking tips, making it an invaluable tool for anyone passionate about cooking. This approach not only showcases the flexibility and potential of LLMs to adapt to specific fields through fine-tuning but also highlights the project's capacity to be hosted as a dynamic, user-friendly application.
As a proof of concept, "Chef AI" currently processes a single load of data to fine-tune its responses, with the model training happening via Google Collab. However, the vision for the future includes automating the data collection process to update the model weekly with the latest posts from the AskCulinary subreddit while hosting this process and the model on some managed cloud infrastructure. This continuous learning approach ensures that "Chef AI" remains at the cutting edge of culinary trends and discussions, further enhancing its ability to provide relevant and up-to-date culinary insights. Through this project, we explore the potential of personalized AI solutions that cater to specific interests, paving the way for more targeted and adaptive AI applications in various domains.
