How can I purposely get clumps in my spaghetti,"I find that I unintentionally produce this effect when I overcrowd the pasta in a pan and forget to agitate it while it is cooking. As the pasta softens it becomes sticky and holds to the neighboring pieces of pasta. Let it go like this long enough and it becomes irreversible, as the pasta fuses into clumps. Also, I am not sure that you want to risk it with the amount of pasta that you have at the moment, but another way to produce a variation on this is to par cook the pasta, cool it down, and then mix in some eggs and Parmesan for a spaghetti bake. When you bake this for a while - on a 9x13 baking dish, for example -  the pasta becomes clumped together thanks to the binding affect of egg. Maybe something to try on down the line."

Why do we leave the tails on shrimp? Especially in dishes that shouldn’t need our hands like noodle dishes.,"So my family was poor for a long time and scratched for every nice thing. Most of our clothes were hand-me-downs and I only ever had like 2 pairs of shoes. 

But one time my parents took us to a really nice restaurant (I think it was probably like a Ruby Tuesday's, but by our standards, it was a 5 star place) and my brother (around 12yo) decided he wanted to try shrimp. So he ordered a big bowl of shrimp alfredo and it came with their tails on. He didn't know any better and apparently none of us were paying attention to him, so he ate the whole bowl (because wasting food was a terrible thing in our family) with their tails on. 

In the end we asked how he liked it and he struggled to put on a grateful smile and said, ""it was good, but it was crunchy and I think I have it stuck in my teeth."" And that's when we finally realized he had eaten the tails. All the tails. Because we don't waste food."
What to do with 400 pounds of hamburgers and hotdogs?,"Kind of an unorthodox idea, but in addition to using a lot of the ground beef for meatloaf, why not set up something cool like letting your customers buy/donate lunch for first responders, and the lunches are...hamburgers, hot dogs, and meatloaf!

I read that book like a novel, and over the next six months I did almost nothing but cook your book.  Finally, I realized how much ""food matters"", and decided to go to culinary school.  I graduated top of my class, moved all over the country (Canada) to continue to cook, learn, and grow.

"Making Ivan Ramen's ""Vegetable fat""?","Love your dedication. I'm Ivan's chef and wanted to fill you in on the vegetable fat. Let's make 1L of product. Ingredients needed: 18g kombu powder, 6g aonori, 6g chipotle powder, 1L canola oil, 100g whole peeled garlic cloves. 

Using a heavy bottomed pot add canola and garlic and cook over low heat until garlic is beyond tender but do not allow caramelization. 

Remove from heat and strain garlic. Reserve garlic for another use. Allow oil to cool and add remaining ingredients to oil. Use an immersion blender to disperse dry ingredients. Allow to sit 24 hours before use. Contents will settle so stir really well before using.

Does bay leaf really make a difference?,"If you want to get an idea of the flavour of bay leaves, warm up some milk to boiling point with a couple of dried leaves, switch off the heat and let it infuse for 15 minutes. It isn't mild by any means (though nor is it strident like rosemary or oregano) - but it is easy to overlook in a complex dish because it has a sort of alto/tenor ""inner voice"" quality which doesn't draw attention to itself.

You can use the milk mixture to make any white sauce, especially with fish (eg a British fish pie). It also makes outstanding egg custard, better than vanilla IMO in a sort of medieval-hipster way. Another excellent recipe is Marcella Hazan's [pork stewed with porcini and juniper](https://rhubarbfool.co.uk/tag/marcella-hazan/) (I wouldn't bother to crumble them). There is a lot going on there but the bay is an important part to my taste.

I find the taste of fresh bay leaves unpleasant and always used dried. They store reasonably well as best I can tell.

Edit: opinion on fresh versus dried withdrawn for further testing."

Would it be bad etiquette to ask a restaurant for a recipe?,"It's just like asking out a potential romantic partner- not at all rude to ask, but if you get a ""no"" and kick up a fuss you'd be a total asshole.

Many times those of us in the industry have no problem with people knowing our recipes because that's not the hard part- it really is more about the technique, reliably sourcing great ingredients, making everything from scratch even when a dish only calls for an ounce, and getting your mise en place set perfectly. If you take the recipe home and don't get good results, you'll come back because you know you don't have the chops. If you take the recipe home and get great results, you'll come back because you know exactly how much work we did to get it right, and having someone else do that for you is absolutely worth it. Either way we win- and we get to be gracious doing it."

"Update to “Is it overkill to spatchcock, buttermilk marinade, AND rub an herb butter on a roast chicken?”",Nice work! Pan drippings will definitely burn at those temps but you can add a little water/beer/stock to the pan and keep it topped off. If you do this without the tinfoil in a roasting pan (I've even had good luck with aluminum baking trays which sounds similar to what you used) you can scrape up all the stuff on the bottom and make a nice jus. The liquid keeps the drippings from burning.
What's up with mac'n'cheese?,"It is classic comfort food (hygge?). It can be eaten as a whole meal on its own, or can have sides or additions like cut up sausages or vegetables, but usually without. 

It is a heavy creamy sauce so if you eat a lot you’ll feel tired. Kids usually love it, but most people like it. 

The cheese is usually based on a mild cheddar, but there are tons of variations. 

A popular product here is also boxed instant Mac and cheese where the cheese sauce is a powdered mix that you just add to water or milk. It tastes.. kind of like fake cheese, but people are accustomed to the taste. The boxed Mac and cheese can be found in most American or Canadian pantries (Canadians eat a LOT of it, specifically Kraft brand) and it is an inexpensive food so it might be eaten more in a low income household but it isn’t an indicator that the home is low income."
I just want to express my gratitude to this sub.,And the cycle continues 😊 thanks for the baking soda brown sugar tip!!
Why are so many Americans obsessed with “kosher salt”?,"Kosher salt has larger crystals than table salt, making it easier to grab and season food with, making it less dense (and thus easier to add by hand without small volume differences making a large salinity difference) and (for some varieties, namely Diamond brand kosher salt) giving it a much nicer texture when it hasn't dissolved into the food. This means professional chefs and most cookbook writers use kosher salt for everything and thus they will typically specify ""kosher salt"" in the ingredients, otherwise the same amount of table salt will make the food very salty. Kosher salt is also not iodized, and some people dislike the taste of iodized salt, especially chefs, who often care a lot about how food tastes.

As for what's up outside of America, I can't really say."

"What are the differences in ingredients / restaurant food supply sources between low end, middle range, and high end dining establishments?","I have been in restaurant food supplies for 18 years and worked for 6 different suppliers. I don't think I even know where to begin with debunking all the misinformation in this thread already. 

This is a much more huge and complex question than most people realize. Even the high end dining establishments with two very similar menus can have two completely different sourcing strategies. There are some kitchens that do so many things completely from scratch but I think people would be surprised to find out how many items come premade in high end kitchens as well. Take for example something as completely simple as French Fries. I can walk into a kitchen that serves $40-$50 entrees and find a box of frozen Lamb Weston french fries that are hand cut with skin on and been properly washed, blanched and frozen. I can also walk into a low end kitchen and find a Lamb Weston box of french fries but those are scraps from cuts that have just been frozen. Same manufacturer, same plant, same machine, it just a different french fry that gets boxed. Fewer than 5% of restaurants cut their own french fries and given the quality of the more expensive frozen fries, there isn't always a reason to. You would be surprised at how far food science has come and what items are coming from premade and frozen. There are different tiers of frozen though. You will find a freezer in every higher end restaurant. Fewer than 1% of restaurants use no frozen items. 

I see a lot of misinformation on produce supply as well. The small independent produce supplier has the same box of Mann's lettuce as the big boys. Farms want to most stable supplier to offer them contracts on their supply. So often times the first pick of the fields go to the big guys. In fact US Foods and SYSCO both have employees that go to farms and pick what fields they want their supply to come from. Plus they have their own distribution so often the produce makes it onto a truck within 48 hours of being harvested. The small guys have to wait for the rest of the fields to be shipped to terminal markets and buy from whole sale suppliers there often meaning they hold product longer. Also smaller suppliers do not have food safety measures in place. The reason to go with a produce specific company for higher end restaurants is that they offer more specialty items, can make up for poor quality by doing 2nd runs same day and offer more delivery days. All of this could relate to meat as well. 

Frozen gets a bad rap but often times chefs prefer some things frozen. Take green peas for example. They can be frozen at peak of freshness whereas most fresh that comes in is hard to keep from getting too soft, so most chefs buy frozen even in scratch kitchens. Bread can very well be another example. Bread can be frozen at peak freshness and thawed and resume at near the same state. A lot of bakery suppliers offer shelf stable bread that is several days old. I have worked for a bakery that does fresh daily bread but how many restaurants get daily deliveries? We may have baked fresh every day but if we deliver a load and it's 3 days until the next delivery you are eating 3-4 day old bread at your higher end restaurant. 

Just throwing out another random example is Hollandaise sauce. Medium to higher end restaurants that do brunch don't always find a benefit of doing their own hollandaise. You'd be surprised at how many buy it in jugs. However, that really expensive shelf stable hollandaise is not the same hollandaise the small diner is buying. Yes you can tell the small diner doesn't make their own hollandaise because it's chalky and not rich. The higher end if very hard to tell.

A common cutting tactic among food distributers is have chefs blind taste test high end pre made products vs their own and it's always surprising how many they cannot find a quality difference. The main point is there are different tiers of premade and quality food. People have a perception of how medium to high end restaurants source and I think you'd be very surprised to go look at the back of house boxes.

Last note is when I'm talking about higher end restaurants I am talking of restaurants with $30-$50 entrees and not Michelin star places. Those are a different beast. Like I said in the beginning there are differences among EVERY restaurant. I can walk you into a place with less than $10 entrees that is all made from scratch and I can walk you into a $30 entrée place that is majority premade higher end products.

Ok really last note now. COVID caused a lot of restaurants to throw out large amounts of inventory and lay off staff so many have no one to prep products now so even more than before is sourcing higher end quality premade and frozen products.

EDIT: thinking about it, we often discuss with chefs what truly counts as ""from scratch"". Less than 100 years ago every chef and even home cook knew how to make cheese. How many restaurants make their own cheese now. I don't know of a single one. If you had a chef from 100 years ago walk into a kitchen today and see chefs using a prepacked cheese, even if it's higher end, they would scoff that they aren't really making their own. However, if a chef adds it to a dish today and the rest is made themselves, they are considered to still have done it from scratch. 

Take milled flour as well. There used to be so many local mills because flour used to go bad quickly! So you had to have it milled close to homes. Flour today has additives in it to make it shelf stable. Virtually every kitchen in the world uses this shelf stable flour with additives and no one bats an eye. Pastry and cakes and anything else made with it is still from scratch but yet if we got a piece of meat or sauce with additives in there we would scoff. 

The point is the industry has continually moved towards products that a short time ago would be considered not fresh or from scratch. The industry is continually moving there and some restaurants are more ahead of the curve than others. I think some of the things we scoff at restaurants for not doing themselves right now will be common place before the end of most of our lives."

Caramel apples are really just that? Raw fruit?,Yeah that's it
I just moved into an apartment that used to be a restaurant. So I have my own personal restaurant-grade wok stove. Got any tips?,"Here's things in random order as I think of them.   

First off, you're gonna burn things. A lot of things. It's a learning experience.  Don't let anyone tell you to turn down the heat.  I mean... turn down the heat for some things, but other things where you need the firepower, learn to use the heat rather than tame it.  

The absolute most important thing to know (outside of the fire extinguisher) is mise en place.  You have literal seconds before things start burning so you don't have time to stop and get something when the train starts rolling.    

Equipment wise, you'll need a ladle (which you already have), a wok spatula, a metal strainer that fits over a pot with the pot, and a bamboo brush. First two are obvious. You'll use one or both tools to manipulate the food.  The metal strainer (google wok strainer, it'll look kinda like a wok but with holes) is to filter food cooked in oil.  The pot holds the oil.  Something without handles is best. Measure your work area to find one that fits the front part.  This is where you effectively oil blanch foods. Use this oil to cook with as well.  

The bamboo brush is how you clean the wok.  After you're done cooking a dish, use the ladle and ladle some water out of the water ""can"".  ""Wash"" (more like rinse) and use the brush to get any food particles.  The wok burner itself should have a drain and a basket to collect food particles.   If it doesn't, dump it in the sink with a strainer.  
Some of the fancier wok setups have a 2nd burner for a pot of water. This is meant to be used for blanching and as a source of water.  Since you don't have this, keep a metal ""pot"" of water around. You don't want to fiddle with the tap during cooking.  
Measure the back part to fit it there.   

Use your knee to adjust the flames.  Things getting out of control or you have to add a few things? Turn it down a little.  Yeah I broke my own rule. It was more meant for ""cook on low"".   

Everyone and their dog says use day old rice for fried rice. This is only true if you don't have a wok burner.  You're one of the few lucky ones that can use fresh rice.  Cook some off 1:1 water:rice.  It's a low ratio.  Spread it out on a plate to cool when cooked.  
Here's where you prep things like eggs/chicken/bbq pork/shrimp/etc.  

When you're ready to cook, oil the rice and set aside.  Oil the wok, add the eggs, and scramble.  Set those aside. Highest heat you can get and oil the wok again (fairly heavily) and dump in the rice.  Break it up as much as you can with the spatula. Basically ""chop"" it.  Toss the rice and continue breaking it up using the back of the ladle in a beating motion. Continue this toss and and beat until your rice toasts. Add in your cooked chicken/pork/shrimp/whatever. Add your eggs, a handful of peas, and bean sprouts. Toss again to incorporate.  Add salt.  Taste.  Adjust with more salt.  Toss once more and plate.  The perfect actually fried rice.  

For something like mixed veg, you want to blanch the veg.  Heat the wok, add in some garlic, then the blanched veg.  Add a seasoning sauce (we had a ""generic"" one with white pepper, chicken powder, salt, and a few other things) but you can use anything you want.   Add in some water and mix in a corn starch slurry.  Heat til thick and plate.  Most of the cooking is done via blanch.   

Chow mein (and veggies), blanch the noodles and drain.  Heat up, oil in, noodles in, water in, soy sauce in.  The water helps distribute the soy evenly.  Cook off the water and you're effectively done.  We used our ""generic"" seasoning but again, use anything you want.  

Any other dishes you're curious about or if you need more than basically a bullet point that I gave above, feel free to ask."

What's the deal with red velvet cake?,"Red velvet was originally a version of chocolate cake made with cocoa powder, buttermilk and vinegar. The chemical reaction between natural cocoa powder which contains anthocyanin, a pH-sensitive antioxidant that reacts to acids and the vinegar and buttermilk caused it to have a red hue. Many bakeries will add food colouring to make the red more vivid. Either way, its chocolatish reddish cake."
You can't make mayonnaise during a lightning/thunderstorm,"We constantly have electrical currents around us, especially so in the modern era.  Unless an emulsion is subjected to direct current, I can't see how a storm would effect more than the current in your wall.

Why are some cheeses traditionally sliced in squares (like Cheddar) while some are traditionally sliced in circles (like provolone).,"This Reddit comment is consistent with what I was able to just Google myself: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1pwyua/eli5_why_does_are_some_cheeses_sliced_in_squares/cd6zbn1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

* For deli cheeses, they are cut to consumer expectations.  
* For cheeses that have undergone a large amount of modernization for mass manufacture, most likely they will be in square slices better suited to mass production.  
* Traditional cheeses are likely in wheel shapes to allow for even distribution of bacteria, easier ability to apply pressure during the cheese making process, or easier to move from point A to B.  
* Cheeses that rely on mold may have crisp edges that facilitate mold growth.

Depends on tradition, expectation, and demands of production.

"Toasting spices to improve flavor is a common culinary practice. But Western cooks ""bloom"" spices (making them stronger) while Indian cooks ""temper"" spices (making them milder). Blind taste test, what actually happens?","If you're willing to wait, and no one has answered meanwhile, I know someone who knows the answer to that question. I'll be reaching out to them, but I don't know how long will it take for me to receive a reply.

...

Alright, here’s the answer. I’m sorry for the delay.


Since my contact is a chemist and not an anthropologist, I’m afraid neither him nor I will be of much assistance in that department. I apologize in that regard. However, some of the answers in the thread like u/justanothercook ‘s and u/shreddedlikechedda ‘s provided a more cultural approach, which covers the topic of “blooming” and “tempering” better than I could.  Aside of that, we discussed, with the assistance of OP, the variables that affected the result in this culinary process. We’ve also been making some assumptions (e. g.: temperature is ideally T<180ºC or 180ºC<T<200ºC. We considered refined olive oil since the smoke point is above 200ºC. We also assumed the optimal storage conditions for all the ingredients). This is the conclusion:


“[…] The question is complex and can only be answered in general terms. It will obviously depend on:



1)       Whether the spice is whole or grounded, and the size of the grounded spice


2)       Temperature of the oil


3)       Quantity of oil used


AROMATIC EXTRACTION: As you’ve said, the oil acts as a dissolvent and extracts liposoluble compounds with less effort. The quantity of oil and spice used will impact in the concentration of aromatics extracted in the oil. Aside of that, heat can affect the extraction, but in this case depends on the volatility of the aromatic compounds, since too high a heat will cause some of these compounds to disappear. Some aromatic compounds are not as volatile as others when heated, which comes to say that when you apply high temperatures, the oil is richer in these more stable compounds, resulting in a different flavor.


AROMATIC ALTERATION: Regarding chemical reactions, there are multiple taking place, since there’s a huge amount of aromatic compounds and these vary depending on the spice you’re using, but in your case most of these are related to the size of the grounded spice (more contact with oxygen) and the temperature of the oil. A higher heat and a finer grain will mean a more noticeable alteration of these compounds. Also, the grinding size will affect from the moment of the grinding, so using a freshly grated spice will be different from using an already-ground version.”


To my understanding, Indian cooks often use a lot of oil, high temperatures and whole spices, while these variables (the ones listed in the quote above) differ in the Western version, hence the different result. I think a fun exercise to do at home would be to play with all that, if you’re up to the challenge. If anyone does, it would be cool to have their observations. I don’t think much else can be said with certainty without entering too hard into the food chemistry field.


I’ve been translating from my native tongue to English and back, so I’m sorry if something seems out of place. I also made a very ugly drawing to illustrate all the possible outcomes we discussed (I can't seem to share it in this subreddit, so ask me and I'll DM it to you). This one is not translated but can be understood.

 

I hope the answer can somewhat sate your curiosity. Thank you for the interesting question, and all the people that helped find an answer. Have a good day."

Can I freeze fresh squeezed lime juice for later use in drinks? Will there be a noticeable drop in quality?,Freeze it in an ice cube tray and transfer the cubes into ziploc(s).  The cubes will remain good for a few months.  Wash your hands - lime peel oil plus even a few minutes in the sun equals a nasty sunburn (photosensitizer).

"Chefs, is it rude to ask for steak well done?","Professional line cook here. Cooks are generally not _insulted_ when someone orders a well-done steak. It does not constitute a judgement on the quality of our product or the qualifications of our team. There are some modifications/requests that _do_ frequently offend the sensibilities of the cook staff, but a well-done temp isn't among them.

An order for a well-done is still upsetting though, for several reasons. A well-done generally takes longer to cook than _anything else_ on the menu, which can drag an order and disrupt the flow of service. Also, good cooks generally like to make good food, and they generally think of a well-done as being bad food. It's dispiriting to take good product (steaks are often the most expensive line item on the food budget, per portion) and be ordered ""ruin"" it. To many cooks it seems irrational or ignorant to order the most expensive thing on the menu, only to have it rendered tough and tasteless. Cooks have an ongoing low-level simmer of contempt for all customers, but being forced to enable their poor judgement in such a way can cause that disdain to boil over.

So while ordering a steak well-done _does upset_ the cooks, it's not exactly _rude_. The cooks are a haughty and judgemental lot, and in their view someone who orders a well-done is perceived as lacking in refinement, knowledge, and/or personal strength of character."
Are there different cuts of meat in different cultures or does everyone basically butcher the same way?,"Yes, different cultures have different cuts of meat, however they mostly all follow the same patterns because the musculoskeletal structure of the animals doesn't change. A good example of this would be the differences in American (US) style butchery and Spanish butchery. The primal cuts are pretty much the same with some debate as to where the major cuts should be made however the sub primal get broken down very differently. Two major factors that affect the subprimal cuts are intended use and cutting equipment. In more industrialized societies you see more of what would be called square cutting, where a butcher breaks the primal down into more uniform cuts based on where it is easiest to cut through the bones with a band saw. In countries with a longer tradition of butchery/charcuterie you see more of what would be called seam butchery where primals are broken down into muscle groups and individual muscles with as little use of a band saw as possible. There are also regional differences in the names given to certain cuts which can lead to confusion as well."

How are different pasta shapes used differently?,"It can be divided into a few main categories. Pasta with ridges holds sauce better. Long pasta goes well with larger pieces e.g. clam or lobster. Spiral shaped pasta collects thicker sauces in the grooves. And then the more obvious, sheets of pasta are for lasagne, various stuffed pasta is for stuffing, jumbo pasta like cannelloni or shells are for baking.

A lot of it comes down to history and tradition too. Certain pastas are more associated with certain sauces. Sort of what your grandmother would make you."
What to do if my Girlfriend has absolutely NO palate.,"In scientific studies, [super tasters actually far prefer saltier foods on average](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/06/16/127880219/for-supertasters-a-desire-for-salt-is-in-their-genes) because salt helps mask the bitter flavors that they’re genetically sensitive to.  You can even get a [test to determine whether or not you’re actually a super taster](https://supertaster.com).

Super tasters will also physically have more tastebuds crammed onto their tongues.  You can check this for free [by counting the number of papillae on the tongue](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/super-tasting-science-find-out-if-youre-a-supertaster/) with a drop of blue food coloring, a hole puncher, and some wax paper.

Your wife might be a super taster of some variety, but to be frank, she may also just be stuck in a deeply ingrained pattern of food.  I’ve known people who pull the super taster card, and turn around and consume plenty of things that super tasters should definitely not enjoy.  They’re more likely just stubborn about food, which is a difficult thing to overcome as it’s often established in childhood and has a psychological component—you can’t just get rid of with food you find so delicious anyone should love it.  There are also sensory sensitivities to textures that go beyond super-tasters.

It might be a good start to cook *together* more often.  Maybe follow an exact recipe at first, so neither of you are “allowed” to dictate the flavor (still tame things that aren’t too explorative, pasta pomodoro instead of coratella con carciofi if you catch my drift).  The book “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” by Samin Nosrat also makes for a wonderful audio book to listen to together, that might help her understand the way that flavors really work together in creative ways."

How to eat Olive,"Likely, the cuisines you're more familiar with have some kind of very intense pickled food. Treat it like that! You can chop them and eat them in pasta dishes, sprinkle them in salad and put them on sandwiches as a sort of condiment. Or you eat them together with some other small snacks like crackers, nuts or crudites with a drink. For a quick pasta dish, fry half a white onion, some chili if you want to, one clove of garlic and an anchovie (if you can't find anchovies, maybe you can get your hands on fish sauce?) in olive oil. 

Add 250ml of canned tomatoes and a bit of water. Then stir in two tablespoons of chopped olives and a tablespoon of chopped capers (if you have them) as well as dried oregano (if you have some). Serve over spaghetti and add parmesan cheese liberally. Ecco: Easy pasta puttanesca."
Why do recipes insist on using whole canned tomatoes when they want you to immediately crush them or break them into pieces anyway?,"Besides the additives in diced tomatoes to help hold shape, whole tomatoes are often the best quality and most versatile.

"Lrrr from Omicron Persei 8 here: when baking, why does the batter simply not eat the oil sprayed into the pan?","The oil ""wets"" the surface, so there's some adherence force. If the next steps in the recipe or the batter are likely to be aggressive in removing the oil they'll call for the oil to be lightly coated with flour, which allows the oil to maintain a thicker layer.

In savory recipes (meatloaf, lasagna, imam bayildi casserole) I often sub finely ground pepper for the flour. It holds the oil equally well and adds an interesting flavor contrast in the crust."
How to make Salt and Vinegar Seasoning.,"I think it's really cool that you went through a more scientific process to make the salt.

Why is my cheese sauce always grainy?,"Some people are suggesting entirely different ingredients like sodium citrate or evaporated milk. Which are fine. But let's fix your actual problems. 

First. Measure out your fat and flour for the roux. On lowish heat make sure if you use butter all the water is evaporated from it - not just melted butter used immediately. Add flour, stir stir stir, cook it down on low heat till it's incorporated and a minute or two past that. 

Then add milk. Add a little at a time. First it clumps terribly then it gets thick and liquid then it gets thin like it's just milk. You use 1 tbsp / 1 tbsp / 1 cup as your ratios.  

Then you keep gently simmering until your bechamel gets actually a bit thick instead of just watery. 

Then you can kill the heat, I just use the lowest heat possible instead. 

Then you add cheese. A little at a time, stir to incorporate. Like maybe a half handful. Make sure you shred your own cheese. 

This will work every time and give you good cheese sauce. You need a shitload of cheese for baked mac and cheese, like, at minimum 1.5 pounds cheese to 1 pound dry pasta.

Now marinate in soy/sugar/cornstarch for a few minutes while you prep everything else.

"My curries always lack a richness, sweetness, and depth of flavor no matter what I do - this NYT chicken curry NYT recipe is the latest example of bland flavor and I'm stumped","Don't use white people curry recipes, it's as simple as that.

Another thing that's important to know when cooking Indian is that there's quite a distinction between ""home style"" and ""restaurant style"", the latter meaning waaayyy more butter, cream, ghee, etc. is used. If you think you miss richness, then that's exacty what's what going on here. 2 ts ghee for 4-6 servings is cute and all, but in a restaurant they'd use at least twice as much.

"Demystifying the ""how spicy would you like it on a scale of 1-5?"" question at American Thai restaurants?","Hi I am a Thai chef and can probably answer this question decently. In your run of the mill restaurant it is likely just how much dried pepper they use which is a damn shame. I eat hot food but some places will ruin a dish by just making it dry with the amount of pepper flakes they put on it. Truthfully, you can almost always order a 3 or 2 and it will be fine. Not disgustingly unbalanced but also not missing the heat. Now for the more detailed answer. 

In thai food they don't use chili oil very often. It exists as a product of China but they don't use it nearly at all. Some regional foods are hotter than others and it can determine which type of chili is used. Some use dried, some use less spicy but fresh peppers. Eastern Thai (also called Issan Thai) is the hottest regional cuisine but northern Thai is genrally not that spicy by comparison. I don't believe in artificially scaling heat.  Thai food is all about balance of flavor with heat being a key component. Not all thai food it naturally hot. Some is disturbingly spicy. Next time you go to your local spot, don't order pad thai or massaman curry or something normal like that. Instead try something like;

Laap/Larb/Laab/Meat Salad with stick rice
Kra Prao (or something pronounced like kapow)
Or my favorite, Khao Soi

Laap is a mixed bag on how its made but when done well, it's the absolute best.

Please help.","Rest for less time, and use a warm plate, but also, the ""rest"" is the time starting the second the steak leaves the grill and ending the second your knife hits the steak. If you pay close attention, you may find that your rest clock is starting a couple minutes after you actually pull it (once you've dealt with shutting off the grill, etc.), and that when it ends you're still gathering utensils, serving up side dishes, pouring a drink, etc. Meaning your ""10 minute"" rest has effectively become 15 or 20 minutes.

Thanksgiving might be a little weird this year. We'll help you get ready,"As a vegan, nobody wants to eat my Thanksgiving food. So every year I cook an entire Thanksgiving feast for myself, everybody declines my food with a smart-ass and completely unnecessary comment, and then I have the best meals for the next week and a half.


Edit: For anyone interested, I always make a lentil loaf, mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes, stuffing (technically it's dressing), cranberry sauce (homemade),  steamed green beans, mac 'n cheeze, biscuits, and a pumpkin cheezecake with a gingersnap crust. My snarky family has no idea what they're missing out on.


Edit 2: The recipes. 


Lentil loaf recipe can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan1200isplenty/comments/jinpqv/earlier_this_month_i_got_sick_and_tumbled_hard/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Recipe is in photos and the alterations I make are in the comments.


-----------------------------

I recommend Imagine Vegan Wild Mushroom Gravy. Normally I prefer to make my own gravy, but this one is so delicious that I make an exception. Plus it saves me some time.

--------------------

The vegan cheeze sauce recipe I use can be found [here](https://www.veggiesdontbite.com/ultimate-cheese-sauce/#wprm-recipe-container-9976). I have been vegan for 18 years and in that time I have tried so many vegan cheese sauce reciped I've lost count. After I came across this recipe a few years ago, I knew my search for the perfect vegan cheese sauce was over. This is IT. This vegan, cheesy, liquid gold.


‐---------------------------

I use the above cheese sauce to make my vegan mac 'n cheeze. I came up with this recipe because I was working on starting up a vegan food truck pre-COVID. Even if you aren't gluten-free (I'm not), use these gluten free bread crumbs for the most perfectly crispy topping. If you're curious about how it looks, I posted it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganFoodPorn/comments/cex1qs/been_busy_creating_recipes_for_the_food_truck_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) a while back.


Vegan Baked Mac'n ""Cheese"" 

• 1 Serving Vegan ""Cheese"" Sauce
• 3 oz. Canned Unsweetened Coconut Milk
• 1 Serving of Tinkyada Brown Rice Pasta
• 10 grams Miyoko's Vegan Cultured Butter, melted
• 25 grams Ian's Gluten Free Bread Crumbs
• 1/4 tsp Frank's Red Hot Original Sauce
• 1/4 tsp Smoked Paprika 

Pre-heat oven to 450°. Boil pasta for 2 minutes less than package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water. 

Over low heat, combine ""cheese"" sauce and coconut milk until smooth. Pour drained pasta into sauce and fold gently until past and sauce are thoroughly incorporated. Pour into a small baking dish. 

In a small bowl combine melted Miyoko's, bread crumbs, hot sauce, and paprika. Stir until well mixed. Sprinkle over pasta. Bake for 20 minutes. 

Makes 1 Serving

The trend in toxic kitchen environments,"It’s perpetuated by hothead chefs and the fraternity idea that everyone has to undergo hazing. Fortunately there are significant improvements I’ve seen in the last couple decades since I started cooking professionally. In my own kitchen, we do not allow yelling, swearing, or publicly dressing-down other cooks. If someone makes a mistake you wait until after service and take them aside to talk about it.

It does mean in some ways things are less efficient as prep cooks don’t have that fire under their ass to produce faster or get screamed at. But we more than make up for that in extremely low turnaround. Our cooks start with us and stay with is so we have great institutional knowledge which saves us a ton of effort in hiring and training. End of the day it works better for morale, morality, and the bottom line.

I also think Gordon Ramsay in particular has a lot of blame on his shoulders for this. He saw the ratings that the shouty chef personality got him on TV and just went with it. The result is generations of cooks who think it’s acceptable to behave like an asshole to coworkers, and highly toxic, macho kitchens that make work unfairly difficult, especially for women and minorities.

EDIT: Sorry, I wasn't clear. I didn't mean to imply that Ramsay started this. The abusive kitchen has existed for a LONG time (read Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, or Jacques Pepin's memoirs, E.G.), just that in the age of the celebrity chef, Ramsay became the poster child for the idea that you need to abuse your staff in order to get good results, and consequently, many young cooks these days think it's OK to behave that way because a guy like Gordon Ramsay has given them his blessing. He didn't create abusive chef culture, but he has historically gone out of his way to use his incredibly huge influence to perpetuate it, and it makes me sad to think of the number of young cooks who have had to face abusive, toxic work environments due to Ramsay's wide-reaching influence."
We get A 1/4 cow and the farm just called and said ours is “blueberrying” and it’s just a visual thing and they don’t know why sometimes it happens and we will get $1 off per pound. I have no idea if this is ok or what it is. I can’t find any reference to it.,"From the time I spent as a Meat Inspector, this was something that happened fairly rarely but no one really knew a cause. Many seasoned butchers tended to suspect it happens because there was not a great bleed and enough draining time at slaughter. It tends to be more common in pigs that are electrically stunned. It also doesn’t show up on a fresh carcass, but shows up as the carcass ages and progresses through the rigor process. 

It mainly just doesn’t look great. There shouldn’t be actually any residual blood and it should not impact flavor or your ability to cook with it."

"Are there ""movements"" in the history of the culinary arts, as there is in music, painting, etc?","Yes, there have been plenty of movements since the onset of 'haute cuisine'. There was the transition from French style dining (where the cooks would create an impressive ""display"" table for each course that was laden with food, and the diners would stay seated while the tables were taken in and out of the room) to Russian style dining (courses served pre-plated), the huuuuge shift to nouvelle cuisine, which lost a lot of the heavy sauces and extremely fatty, dense dishes in favor of lighter, fresher plates that is still a very persistent aesthetic today.

More recently, there was the food truck fad, the fusion fad, the molecular gastronomy fad, the farm to table movement, the nose to tail movement, etc etc etc. Right now the world is very focused on environmentally sound methods of eating, like minimizing waste and re-using things - to the point where it's a useless aesthetic in most restaurants (think about all the trendy restaurants that use mason jars for their cocktails - the idea obviously is that they're rustically re-using those jars and that's what they're trying to imply about their food, but the reality of course is that they buy those new and solely for the purpose of containing drinks). 

The culinary world, like the art world, is still an extension and reflection of the society and culture in which it's created."

MSG and preservatives that are common in processed foods are different types of sodium. Sodium chloride, the stuff that tastes “salty” is only one ingredient contributing to overall sodium content. When you’re cooking from scratch at home you don’t really need to worry about how much salt you add because it will become “too salty” before the overall sodium levels reach that of processed foods."

Does anyone remember old school Shanghai buttercream cake? Trying to recreate it for my grandpa's birthday and need recipe recreation advice!,"French buttercream is lovey and rich, and yellow in hue from the eggs. But it does have a custardy flavor to it. I find swiss meringue buttercream to be the butteriest in flavor, and martha stewart’s recipe doesn’t use much sugar compared to some others. Maybe give that a shot. 

Margarine is hydrogenated oil, and every margarine I’ve had is decently salty. It may provide a good balance to the sweetness of buttercream, or it may make it overly salty. It’s also usually much softer than butter, so that may make it difficult to decorate with. Ghee is a clarified butter, so the milk solids are removed. I think the texture of ghee would not work well at all in a buttercream. I’d probably go with just good quality butter. European butters I think have a higher fat percentage than typical american grocery store butter (though Idk if that’s applicable to you lol), and are therefore more yellow in color.

"What's the difference between Cajun, Creole and Old Bay spice mixes?","1. cajun is 'country cooking' in southwest **(Lafayette area, LA).**  the basic 'rules' of cajun cooking are:red pepper (black pepper is rarely used), NO tomatoes (or very, very minimally used in cooking-but consumed on salads, **gumbos are separate** meaning... there's a chicken & sausage gumbo, duck & andouille sausge, etc. and then, there's seafood gumbo.  cajun is also, cast iron skillet, outside, rural, cooking where the protein (mainly pork & chicken) are browned heavily and the veggies are browned in their gratin.  NOTE:  using tomatoes in gumbos and jambalaya in southwest LA will get you run out of town.  some people call this 'old style' LA cooking.
2. creole is 'city cooking' in southeast **(New Orleans area,LA).**  the basic rules of creole cooking are:  black & red pepper, tomatoes are used in most stews, jambalayas, gumbos, etc.  gumbos are also separate with chicken/sausage, seafood, etc.  creole is more 'formal,' i.e., white table cloth, city where the proteins are browned but not as heavily as they are in cajun cooking.  city folks will accept a brown jambalaya but most are used to red jambalaya (that's very good but cooked with tomatoes).  creole is a mixture in itself combining african, spanish, italian, and some native american influences, etc. to the cooking.  cajun cooking doesn't have much outside influence, if any.
3. and then, there's south central **(Houma-Thibodaux area, LA**) cooking which literally combines the cajun/creole cooking methods... mixing it all up and enjoying the whole party.  the John Folse culinary school is located in Thibodaux, LA at Nicholls State University where you can un-learn all that fancy cooking school stuff and learn all the 'weird' techniques people from south LA use to bring out some seriously deep flavors in their food.  i believe it's one of 2 cooking schools that offers a 4 yr culinary degree.  **this area is known for (just) gumbo:  the chicken, sausage, crab, crawfish, shrimp, etc. are all made in ONE gumbo; they are not separated.  NOTE:  my mom will make a chicken stock & a shrimp stock for her gumbo... then add both to the pot equally or she will use only 1; she changes it.**  some people use tomato in their stews and jambalayas, gumbos in this area, but it's kinda rare... but they'll usually tell you if they do bc it's a serious distinction and many don't like tomato 'infecting' their dishes.  peole also used black & red pepper equally and also throw in more garlic than what you'd get in NOLa cooking.

ALL of these regions use the Trinity... onion, celery, green bell pepper as the base for most dishes:  the ratio varies per region and per dish so it's hard to give a rule, but the best way to start is to use 2 parts yellow onion to 1 part celery & 1 part green bell pepper.  then, throw in some garlic until you smell it.

Can you store salt in cast iron?,"No experience directly, but logic says to try it at your own risk. Why do cars rust in the north? Salt + water = rust. Why does untreated salt clump in shakers?

We salt the water water when we make pasta to season it. How come I never see recipes calling for other seasoning or even garlic in the pasta water to flavor it?,"Many flavor compounds, including those in garlic, are fat soluble, and therefore would not transfer to the pasta in the water. Salt is water soluble, so the flavor makes its way in. You could try it with other water soluble aromatics - maybe bay leaves, for example, but you'd need a ton to really make a noticeable difference"

"Is there such thing as ‘cooking theory’, i.e. an abstract set of principles that explains what makes a good dish?","Yes, most definitely.

A really minimalist but effective basis is the famous Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat cookbook and show from one of the chefs that came up in Alice Water's fine restaurant. More comprehensive books would be The Food Lab, How to Cook Everything, and On Food and Cooking.

Here's my own personal theoretical framework, as a moderately skillful home cook that has cooked things that occasionally get praise like ""I dreamed about that dish for several nights"". It's just a hodge podge of what I've picked up, predominantly focused on learning from people like Kenji Alt-Lopez, Harold McGee, Herve This and similar.

Taste is on your tongue. Flavor is in your nose. Your brain combines these into a unified sensation, where texture and appearance matter substantially as well.

Taste is: salty, sour, sweet, bitter, umami.

Flavor is countless volatile organic compounds.

To some extent tastes balance each other. Increasing saltiness and sourness at the same time doesn't taste overly sour or overly salty, just more intensely delicious. Good recipes know what they're trying to target on the 5 tastes and use ingredients in a way that allows you to amplify and balance.

Flavor is more open ended, and where you can go nuts riffing your own ideas.

Besides this, there are a handful of simple physical facts that make a profound difference in your understanding of what you're cooking.

What we commonly call browning is a complex chain of things called the Maillard reaction. This is essential to building flavor in many if not most savory dishes. It's also what makes bread taste delicious even though raw flour is basically inedible. While the reaction begins happening at lower temperatures, 350F is the inflection point of where it starts happening rapidly. As a simple example of how useful this fact is: you can quite easily get a roast turkey to have great crispy skin as well as juicy interior. Use a thermometer to understand where the interior is at. Use your eyes, nose, and scraping with a utensil to understand where the skin is at. If the skin is browning faster than the interior is coming up to temp, back your oven down to 325F or lower. If the interior is getting mostly there but the skin is looking lackluster crank it up to 425F or use the broiler.

A very simple but important related fact is that a liquid mixture will not, on the average, rise above the boiling point of the liquid. You can boil broccoli all day and it won't brown. Put it in the oven and you get something entirely different.

Likewise, collagen, the connective tissue in meat begins decomposing into gelatin around 160F if it's in a moist environment. Again this is an inflection point, and there's a bit of that at lower temps. Fat begins to render (liquify) at around 130F, depending on the specific fat. Proteins denature (read as, go from translucent to opaque, and shrink in the direction of the fibers) at temps above 110F. These facts combine to tell you how to cook nearly any meat properly. Cuts of meat high in collagen should be cooked via moist cooking methods, and taken to fairly high temperatures to allow the fat and collagen to turn into a gelatin that coats the meat fibers. Compared to a steak the meat is way past well done, but the mentioned processes compensate for this producing that utterly tender fall apart texture of stews and great BBQ. Conversely, lean cuts should be handled carefully to avoid overcooking, at which point you'll have all the tight overcooked protein fibers and nothing to compensate for it.

Lastly, you can look at mirepoix, sofrito (of all it's variations across the med and americas), the cajun trinity, etc and see these are all the same fundamental idea and purpose, just a different flavor combination. Same for how a roux is commonly used to provide both flavor and thickening. Once you start seeing these big picture patterns across different culinary traditions, you can improvise your own things that hit the same notes of flavor and mental association (though do not ignore where specific traditions diverge).

Past that it's about learning technique, and how the results of choices in technique generalize. A great example is garlic. Whole vs sliced vs diced vs crushed produce different balances of sweet vs sharply sulfuric flavor. How long you cook garlic, onion, or similar things changes the balance of sharp vs caramelized sweet flavors.

Anyhow, that's a bit of a ranty brain dump, but reflects the big anchor ideas in how I approach cooking. I don't bill myself as a skilled chef. I am good enough to cook food on a regular basis that makes people literally do a double take. It's very near the top of my list of most satisfying things I've learned how to do."
How do restaurants make their scrambled eggs so soft ???,Scrambled eggs continue to cook after they are removed from the stove.   Taking them off when they look done to too late.   I take them off when they look slightly wet on top.  The cooking that occurs from latent heat with give you that softness you want.
"Risotto recipe asks for dry white wine, I have only medium dry red wine and am a year away from being able to legally purchase alcohol on my own. Can I substitute the dry white with medium dry red or is it not advised?","You can certainly utilize red wine in a risotto, but you're going to change the flavor profile a little bit and appearance quite a bit, so it's really your call. I would say you can swap if you're not utilizing any conflicting flavors.

All that said, my advice is to just skip it altogether. Add a dash of white wine vinegar or lemon juice and call it a day. I don't think many risottos would really suffer without the wine."
"[META] I would like to see a weekly (or perhaps even monthly) post where a very staple ingredient is chosen, like Pork Shoulder, and the sub shares recipes and experiences with using it.","You could argue that might be better suited for /r/cooking or a similar sub, but I was specifically hoping to get opinions from professionals or very accomplished home cooks. "
Why does no one practice the strict food safety promoted everywhere on the web? Is it because it's impractical?,"A good restaurant will follow them because that's who they are designed for.  I don't know many home cooks who do because they are, as you stated, kind of impractical.  Most of those rules were created by the FDA and they have zero tolerance for risk.  How much you don't follow the rules is more of a test of your risk tolerance then anything else"

"How do pizzerias have pizza dough that is ""ready"" to be baked to order?","They typically make large batches of dough, sometimes multiple times per day depending on need. These are typically 50 pound bags of flour plus other ingredients, so well over 60 pounds\* of dough per batch.

They then cut the dough into weighted portions and place them on stackable trays that go into the walk-in refrigerator to rise and age. They can then take out just a tray or two at a time to get up to temperature for actual assembly. As long as the dough stays in the fridge, it typically won't overproof before they use it up.

Depending on recipe, they might make the dough the same day or even the day before.

Am I the only one that think real fresh Parmesan smells like vomit???,"Not sure what “fresh” parm is since it’s an aged cheese, but yeah even the good stuff can kind of evoke puke since both have butyric acid (that’s also what makes some people say Hershey’s chocolate has a pukey quality).

Some people are more sensitive to that smell/taste than others. If you don’t like it, don’t feel obligated to cook with it. It’s a fairly different flavor, but pecorino romano can often stand in for parm"
Suggestions for Culinary School type exercises for a home cook?,"This was effectively my Culinary Foundations 1/2 class:

Buy a massive bag of carrots, potatoes, and onions, and get chopping. Download and print a  knife cuts guide. Learn large dice, then cut that into medium and small. Cut batons, cut that into small dice. Cut julienne, cut that into brunoise. Make sure your knife is sharp as all fuck. Go \*slow\* and be super precise at first. Make them perfect, don't go for speed. You'll get faster over time. Practice this literally like 15-30 minutes per day every day (or more if you like), because that's how you get good. That's how I spent the first few months of culinary school.

Learn how to emulsify a vinaigrette from scratch. Make mayonnaise from scratch. Make stock, and then learn to make the mother sauces (Instant pot is fucking fabulous for this, by the way...it's good to learn how to make a chicken stock from scratch once and skim it and stuff, but honestly if you have the IP don't bother after that, and don't bother making beef or veal stock without one).

learn how to make consomme.

Move onto making the perfect seared airline chicken breast and steak. Key if you're cooking at home though is to dry the meat in the fridge uncovered overnight, you get a much better crust that way.

Learn how to make a pan sauce from the pan you've cooked your meats in.

Learn to poach chicken and fish in a flavorful broth.

Learn to make great polenta, rice, rice pilaf, and a couple other grains of your choice.

Learn how to properly blanch veggies and finish them in a nice buttery sauce.

Learn how to make a roast. Learn how to braise (in school we made a cartouche--a braising lid out of parchment paper)

Practice some basic plating. Everyone has different styles, so spend some time googling around and see what you like. Cutting meats on a bias and trimming veggies on a bias makes things hecka fancy looking and takes no extra time.

LEARN HOW TO SEASON WITH SALT PROPERLY. If you're not sure, keep adding more and more and tasting every single fucking thing every step of the way until it's too much. Most of the time people don't realize how much salt things need.

&#x200B;

Most importantly though--learn the food science. Culinary school didn't teach as much of this as I would have liked, but it's so goddamn important to know if you want to be able to get very good. Otherwise you're just repeating what you've practiced, and that might not be the best approach if you don't understand why what you're doing is great. I always like to call Serious Eats my second culinary school for this reason."

Why can a packaged frozen meal have a ton of sodium in it and not taste unbearably salty?,There are other [additives](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet) besides salt that contain sodium. These additives are often flavor enhancers or preservatives.

Why does yogurt look and taste different from sour cream when both are the product of the same process i.e acid acting on protien,"The microbiology here is way more complicated than you are thinking. The many variables and subtle interactions can make a huge difference in what you get. 

They aren't the same because they start with different materials (milk vs cream), use different cultures (mostly lactobacillus spp vs mostly thermophilic spp), and are cultured under different conditions (warm vs hot). Every one of these variables has biological and chemical effects that can drastically change the end product. 

Compare that to cheesemakling; you can start with the same material, use nearly the exact same processes, but if you change one tiny thing (say, the temperature, or the size you cut curds) you get a totally different cheese."

Edit: I find cooking to be especially laborious at the end of summer (August through mid-September here) and at the end of winter (February here). I've made my staples so many times, and I just don't want to have them again. This summer my project was to figure out pita. I did, and it worked really well! But know what I don't want to make right now (not to mention hitting up a 500 degree oven when it's 90 outside)? The flip side is that a change in seasons is a great reason to start making something new. There's new produce around, and that in particular, like /u/rwm0924 alludes to, can really help. Or you can start with a drink you really like and make food to complement it."
Why are people frying turkey whole? Why not just cut it up first into smaller pieces before frying?,[removed]
Why does butter change the flavor of steak so dramatically?,"Personally, I have found butter to add beneficial flavour to all meat.  I can't think of any that doesn't benefit.  Beef, pork, chicken, lamb, goat, fish, shellfish.  All better with butter.

I think there is a stronger tradition of butter with beef because traditionally you could have gotten those two from the same farmer.

As for why beef tastes better with butter then oil.  I think it has to do with our taste sense of fats/lipids.  So recently there has been the discovery of g-coupled protein receptors for fats.  So we have dedicated taste receptors for fats/fatty acids. 

Now if you look at the chemical composition of butter and oil there's one stark difference.  The lipids in milk/butter are shorter (primarily of carbon chains of 4, 6, 8 and 10).  The lipids derived from plants tend to be longer (carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being the most common).  Interesting, looking at beef fat(tallow, also other animal based fats are similar) it is very similar to plant fats with carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being predominant.

So my theory is that these short lipids (C:4-10) hit our lipid g-coupled protein receptors on our tounges different and butter fills in that flavour profile.  For one, smaller molecules have more mobility and could potentially get to our lipid receptors more readily then longer chain fats.  Also, the receptors themselves could be more susceptible to shorter chain fats much like our amino acid receptors are most susceptible to glutamate.

And I do think it's the fats instead of some other flavour in butter because fats+water in butter makes up 98%-99% of its composition.  The others will help, but this is how I see it."
Why is the chicken breast we make at home so horrible compared to restaurant?,"i don't buy chicken breast anymore because of something known as ""woody"" chicken breasts. i feel like that's what you're describing. 

and i really do wonder if restaurants are siphoning them out through expertise in dealing with it. 

but woody chicken breast is like catching an occasional bite of a rubber tire and i'm just not supporting the practice anymore. they're making monster chickens with disgusting meat because they decided the chickens needed to weigh more and it's an abomination. 

buy turkey until they screw that up."

600 lbs. of Green Tomaotes. Need I say more?,"YOU GOT:

Plant em: Shove em in dirt and see what happens

SOUP: You got, tomato basil (equal parts weight tomato and basil and a bit of cream), tomato leek (leeks in stovepot, medium high until lightly caramelized, then 20 min on medium low with 0.5 cup of veggie stock covered. Then, make tomato soup and add leeks), tomato southwestern (corn, tomatoes, corn chips, salt, lime, beans and ground beef if you want)

ROASTED TOMATOES: Shove em in the oven wrapped tightly in aluminum foil at 450 for 35 minutes, until just blackened

STUFFED TOMATOES: Do roasted tomatoes but shove some other stuff in em. Rice, beans, children if you're feeling spooky

SALSA: 2 tomatoes, half a jalapeno, half tablespoon of fine salt, large pinch of flaky salt, half an onion, garlic bits, whatever else goes in salsa

ROASTED SALSA: same but roast it, and then add some more savory and smoky ingredients, like corn, corn chips, bacon, chipotle powder, paprika, smoked flaky salt

HOT SAUZE: look up joshua weissman hot sauce on youtube and follow the recipe but use completely different peppers. A mix of cherry bombs (15%), poblanos (35%), jalapenos (10%), habaneros (5%), and buffer peppers (35%) os good. Instead of a pound and a half, ferment only a pound, and then replace the other half pound with tomatoes. You can also just make the recipe like normal except you happened to put in 3 tomatoes and changed nothing else. It's a robust recipe.

ITALIANS: fill a giant saucepot with butter and tomatoes. Use a stick of butter per baby's volume of tomatoes (about 10 tomatoes). For every two babies' volume of tomatoes (about 15-20), add one onion that you washed but did not peel, and you chopped directly in half and did nothing else to. Add a bucket of salt and then bring to a simmer while stirring. After 20 minutes taste it to see how acidic it is, and add sugar to reduce acidity until it tastes good. You can also roast these tomatoes first, which I would recommend because you have green tomatoes

SMOOTHIE: Like original v8, but just as bad. Fill your blender with tomatoes. Roasted might be better. Then, squeeze out a quarter of a lime for each tomato you put in, maybe a bit less. Add a bit of salt and a lot of hot sauce. Blend. Serve to people in the 80's and tell them that they are supposed to enjoy it.

TOMATO REDUCTION: Take a tomato and blend it, then cook until it's pasty and weird. put a dollop on a plate and move it around with a spoon to make your food look fancy.

FISH DISH: Fry up some cheap fish fillet with salt, pepper, lemon pepper, and sadness, until just blackened. Chop up a tomato on top, keeping the juices so they sizzle when they touch the hot fish and mix with the lemon that you squirted on earlier. PS you shouldve done that earlier. It should sizzle too. Call it salsa verde or something.

AN ENTIRE PIG: Slowly roast an entire pig on an authentic hawaiian grill for 12 full hours while dancing and saluting the sun and the earth's bounty. When nearly finished, place a single tomato inside the pig's mouth to finish. Repeat until all 600lb are used up.

POWDER AND THEN CHIPS: If you know more than I do about tortilla chip making, you can try to make a powder out of reduced and dehydrated green tomatoes, and then mix the powder with the corn flour when making tortilla chips. Should be tasty.

FRIENDS: Make more friends, and then tell them that for a small entry fee, they too can share with their friends the great bounty of the green tomato, sold at a great deal vs. other competitors, exclusive offer, not a pyramid scheme.

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
"I just watched a cooking show, where an Italian chef was frying off prawn shells with I think shallots and garlic etc, and he asked for ice cubes?","He’s using ice cubes instead of water just to help rapidly cool the pan and halt the cooking exactly at the point he wants it. He’s just putting together a really quick shrimp stock. Since it’s being done on the fly in a saute pan, he doesn’t have the luxury of slowly coaxing the flavor out of those shells over lower heat, so what he’s doing is using a ripping hot saute pan and blasting the aromatics and shells with high heat (which is prone to burning) and instead of using water, the ice cubes stop that intense high heat cooking at precisely the moment he wants to. They melt, everything mingles together a bit, and you have basically, an instant, fresh shrimp stock. 🤌"

Knife sharpener said my knives are really poor quality. Thoughts?,"Pro chef, 20 years.

People who sharpen knives for a living rarely use them for a living.  Or if they do, they don’t use them like chefs do.  Those are definitely some higher end knives.  I wouldn’t let anyone else sharpen them, learn to do it yourself.  They’ll last a lifetime.

Professional knife guys use plastic handle, heavy steel knives that they can grind down every few days and replace when they’re beat.  Not cheap knives, but commercial use knives.  Think what you would use at a butcher shop, in a meat room at a grocery, at a catering place with 30 prep cooks and 100 house knives.  

What you have are artisan knives, good/required for certain professional uses that aren’t heavy volume.  If you’re doing sushi you want a knife like you have.  If you’re slicing a handful of prime meats for plating menus, you want your knives.  A chef would prefer yours.  A butcher likely wouldn’t, and they’d get beat quickly doing 8way cuts on whole chickens for 8 hours a day.

Your knife guy is wrong, you have nice knives.  High quality artisan knives.  They’re not commercial or industrial grade, which is ok. Sharpen them yourself from now on, he’ll probably take a mechanical grinder to them, not a whetstone."

Why do people seem to prefer expensive wooden cutting boards to the cheap plastic ones?,"I don't know why people are throwing out such binary answers. There are pros and cons to both.

Plastic pros = cheap, easily replaceable, easy to sanitize with soap and water, can be bleached periodically, easy to colour code for different applications. - There is a reason commerical kitchens use almost exclusively plastic. 

Plastic Cons = hard on your knives, short lifespan, becomes more difficult to properly sanitize after heavy usage, can stain pretty easily. Terrible for the environment

Wood pros = if treated properly with appropriate oils and waxes, creates a hydrophobic surface that liquids don't absorb into. Much better for your knives. Natural antimicrobial properties in many woods. Can last a lifetime. Something very satisfying about cutting on big heavy wooden board. Biodegradable. 

Wood cons = more expensive (though doesn't have to break the bank), requires far more upkeep in terms of treating the wood to maintain the hydrophobic nature, absorbs odors (think garlic). Big and heavy is not always ideal. 

Personally I think there is a place for both.
Pay attention to your plastic boards, and when you start to notice significant surface damage replace them. 
Treat your wooden boards well, and they'll serve you well for a long long time. 

You can find fairly reputable sources online that will say the complete opposite of each other, so it's clearly not as cut and dry (pun intended) as some people in here will have you believe

"Is there a difference between coconut milk you can buy in the supermarket fridges near the regular milk, and canned coconut milk you buy near all the spices, curry pastes, etc?

The canned coconut milk is richer and creamier, which is what normally results from pressing grated coconut flesh. There's another level to this that is coconut cream, which is even more thick.

As far as usage goes, do not cook with the drinking-grade coconut milk because it will be disappointing since it's basically white water, and it's not advisable to drink the canned coconut milk because it will be way too rich."

Why not turkey eggs?,"because they’re very, very expensive. 

quoting from a [slate article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/slate.com/human-interest/2012/11/why-dont-we-eat-turkey-eggs-the-differences-among-chicken-duck-goose-and-turkey-eggs.amp):

“Chicken hens are egg-laying dynamos, dropping one almost every day, while a turkey produces only about two per week. Chickens begin laying eggs at about five months of age, but turkeys don’t have their first cycle until more than two months later. Commercial egg producers typically, although controversially, allocate less than 50 square inches of space to a hen. Turkeys are given more than 3 square feet, enough to accommodate eight chicken hens. Turkeys also require more food than chickens. These factors combine to make turkey eggs far more expensive than chicken eggs. A dozen chicken eggs currently cost approximately $1.61. (Cage-free eggs cost twice as much.) There’s no nationwide data on the cost of turkey eggs—the USDA doesn’t even have grading regulation for turkey eggs—but many producers sell them for $2 to $3 per egg.”"

"Is homemade ice cream texture determined more by the machine you buy, or your technique in making it?","Ice cream texture is a function of recipe, overrun, and freezing time. Recipe is the easy part, but overrun and freezing time are entirely a function of the ice cream machine you use. Non-compressor machines will typically give you a freezing time of 20-30 minutes while a compressor will give you 12-18 minutes, both for 1 L of base. That difference in time has a significant impact on the texture of the ice cream. Overrun depends on the paddle type and rotation speed of the machine, but most home machines will provide a similar overrun - very high overrun typically requires commercial machines.

You'll want to look for a machine with the shortest freezing time possible. Something like a Lello 4080 is ideal but there are cheaper options available like the Breville Smart Scoop or the Cuisinart ICE-100. The more you pay the better the result generally, and when it comes to ice cream machines the price can skyrocket pretty fast, so you'll have to decide what is reasonable for your budget (and counter space)."

The stuff that can live in literal salt solutions are very specifically adapted to doing so, and are actually square in shape. This is because salt is incredibly good at drawing water out of cells, and the microbes themselves have to spend energy to ensure they can maintain a osmotic balance.  This is a very energy costly system to do (proton pumps are quite expensive to run for cells). Lots of the evolved pumps for this are solar powered, but are still energetically costly.

How important is it to wash rice?,Depends on the variety and processing of the rice. In some countries you need to rinse basamti and other long grain rice just to clean them since they are not processed or transported free of contaminant grit. Some long-grain white rice can cook gummy if not rinsed and all rice aside from par-boiled rice is less prone to boil-over in cooking if it is rinsed. Japonica and Calrose rice for sushi sticks together better if you rinse off the excess loose starch residue from the milling/processing before cooking and true Japonica also tastes better if you soak it. It tastes less bitter and more sweet. Something to do with the starches specific to the variety. Soaking other varieties makes no taste difference that I can tell and with long grain rice it can mess up the texture.

How did this restaurant cut their carrots like this? Diagram inside.,"Ah, the ancient, sadistic French culinary tradition of tournage. The blessed craft of turning vegetables into seven sided footballs, a practice designed to torture culinary students into finger cramped insanity.  And yes, it is usually done by hand and ask any ancient French chef to do it and they will execute them perfectly without even looking at their hands while doing so. Something that brings great shame to all who witness.  I can still smell the mounds of turnips that I used to practice making into these [bastard shapes](https://imgur.com/1mhCGhT) with a bird's beak knife.

The word “tournage” comes from the French verb tourner, which means “to turn.” To tourner, or “turn,” vegetables is to cut them into faceted-oval shapes — usually with seven sides — with blunt ends. While the shape is always the same, tournage cuts have varying names depending upon their length. ""BCVCF""- Bouquetière- 3cm, Cocotte- 5cm, Vapeur- 6cm, Château- 7-ish cm and Fondante- massive. I am now having flashbacks to my culinary school finals.

These are one of the traditional taillage cuts like julienne and brunoise that are uniform in French cuisine. They are uniform for several reasons- visual appeal, the same size for even cooking and so every cook in a kitchen makes them the exact same way. 

That said, in all my years as a chef, I think I have had tourned vegetable on maybe two menus. Its more about developing knife skills and discipline.

If those carrots were done in a super traditional French way, they would have been cooked à l’étuvée. In a pan with butter, salt, water and sometimes a little sugar and then a parchment paper lid over the top so that they gently simmer and steam and develop a shiny glaze.

I need to go lay down now."
Need to make a menu sound very ladidah,"First off, I'm sorry to hear about your partner's mum. Really not an easy thing to deal with and he is a very lucky man to have someone trying so hard to cheer him up at such a shit time.

One thing we often do to make stuff sound fancier is say where it's from. Prawns become Obsiblue prawns, olive tapenade becomes Leccino olive tapenade, taramasalata becomes Loch Duart taramasalata, pandoro becomes Veronese pandoro etc. 

Another way is almost like you've done with Love Actually, describing the way it's prepared (laying it on thick how laborious and time consuming it was) and bigging up the whole free range/artisanal aspect.

You could consider going minimalist on the description and just list the ingredients like how some Michelin places do, like for La Dolce Vita i.e
'Veronese Pandoro, Curaçao triple sec, Crème Mousseline, Seville orange ganache'

Some go even more minimalist and it would literally just be:
'Pandoro, triple sec, mousseline, ganache' 
Places like Le Manoir aux quat saison and Le Louis like to do this.

Why do Americans refer to yams and sweet potatoes interchangeably?,The show High on the Hog (Netflix docu series about African American food) talks about this.

Why is washing a pan in water straight away bad while deglazing isn’t?,"Engineer here. Heat and temperature are two separate things. Temperature is what you think it is and heat is temperature times mass. When you deglaze, you have the same temperature differential as dipping the pan in a giant body of cold water, but not the same heat differential because the mass of the pan vs the tiny bit of liquid you put in it is overwhelming and the liquid just heats up quickly and the pan only cools down at a rate relatively equal and opposite the heat it takes the heat the water. When you dunk the pan in the water, the water has a comparable mass to the pan so the pan cools down at a rate that puts it at a risk for warping."

Quickly slicing things that stick to your knife?,"It's to do with the grind of the blade. This helps with ""food release"" as it's called. Cheap knives have smooth, flat sides so when you chop through say, a potato, the slices stick to the flat metal. Higher quality knives have different shapes sides (very simply), these are called S grind or hollow grind or various other names. This creates a gap between the food and the blade so it more easily releases. This is a massive rabbit hole the one can get sucked down, if you want to learn more I'd recommend r/chefknives . And I guess speed and sharp knife definitely helps, just don't hit your fingers!

Cilantro soap taste not present in certain Vietnamese sauces.,"There are two commonly used herbs that taste like cilantro, [saw tooth coriander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryngium_foetidum), and [Vietnamese cilantro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persicaria_odorata). Both are grown and used in south east Asian cooking, and both reportedly lack the Aldehydes that register to some as a soapy taste. Vietnamese cilantro is in fact not even from the same family as cilantro and saw toothed coriander (knotweed family vs aster family) and though its harder to get your hands on (saw toothed coriander can be found in Mexican grocers) my bet is that it's what you had. 

As an aside: I've tasted both and even tested Vietnamese cilantro on two cilantro intolerant persons. Flavorwise I prefer the Vietnamese cilantro; it's like a ever so slightly minty cilantro, whereas I've found saw tooth cilantro to have a dull flavor. And as for my tests, reactions were split, but I suspect the negative taster either strongly associated the flavor with soapyness or just simply disliked the flavor of cilantro and never suffered from the soapy taste."

2. If it doesn't run clear after three rinses it is because you were not stirring enough.   Does Tamiko have to do everything for you?
3. Cook in rice cooker.
4. As soon as rice is cooked empty it into a bowl and fan it until there is no more steam.  Tamiko doesn't care if you're bored. Sit there and fan the rice.  Do you know that in Japan a young chef has to cook rice for five years before he's allowed to cook other food?"
Does anyone else put a roux in their bread dough?,"Pro chef, 20 years.  

Ok so I haven’t ever heard of this, but it makes a ton of sense.  Don’t think of it like roux.  What you’re doing is saturating some flour with butter to make it easier to disperse the butter evenly without messing up the water ratio.  This is a very clever trick and is probably a traditional variation that she learned from her grandmother who learned it from her grandmother as well.  It isn’t thickening, so don’t think of it as roux, think of it like you would think of pressing bits of cold butter into flour for a pasty crust, but the opposite - no thin flakes of butter like a croissant or puff pastry would have, more of a saturated flour that can disperse and make the bread tender.

Bravo grandma 👏"
"Similar to how Cantonese has shaped Western perception of Chinese cuisine, is there a regional cuisine of India that is most noticeable in Western restaurants?","The vast majority of Indian restaurants in the west are representative of Punjabi food, sometimes with some sprinkles of dishes from other provinces thrown in. If you have been somewhere that makes dosa, that would be South Indian which is vastly different cuisine, uses different spices, etc. than Punjabi/North Indian cuisine.

What is the difference between marinating chicken for 30mins vs 2 hours vs 12 hours?,"Most marinades won’t penetrate chicken much past a couple hours. And most don’t actually make the chicken more tender. Some marinades even make the chicken unpleasant if left too long. On the other hand salting chicken and leaving it for 12 hours in the fridge actually tenderizes the chicken. So, for me, I look at the recipe and see what it’s doing to decide what to actually do. If it says to marinate the chicken overnight in an acidic marinade I ignore and do 2 hours. Maybe I’ll have dry brined it the night before with just salt. If the same marinade is being used to prepare the chicken when you cook it, that’s where all the flavor is coming from. So I ignore lots of recipes that call for long marinades. At the same time, I do think there’s a difference between a half hour and say an hour and a half, if the chicken wasn’t brined already."
Why is white pepper more commonly pre-ground in Asia compared to black pepper?,"Ok so I spent a lot of time in southern China where peppercorns are cultivated heavily. The real answer is that when you grind peppercorns (black or white), it exposes the oils inside to the air and it starts to lose its spiciness and oxidize, giving pre-ground pepper that stale, metallic flavor very quickly. In black pepper, this flavor isn’t desirable. That’s why black pepper grinders are so commonplace - the fresh black pepper has a much cleaner flavor that’s preferred so many places grind it fresh. The opposite is true of white pepper (actually the same peppercorn, just without the black outer skin) The white peppercorns are produced by soaking the skins off, which can give them a slightly fermented flavor depending on the length of the soaking process. Once the peppercorns are then ground, that fermented flavor combines with the metallic flavor of the oxidizing oils. This gives the ground white pepper a strong, funky smell/taste that develops over time, and this flavor is actually often preferred to the cleaner, just-ground white pepper flavor especially in *certain East Asian cuisines.

If someone is using just-ground white pepper, it is usually like other comments mention - it’s similar enough to black pepper when fresh ground that you can use it as a substitute when the lighter color is important to the final dish aesthetic.

*edited to reflect that this differs from region to region, some cuisines will use fresh ground white pepper for its lighter flavor"

It’s a little time intensive, but it’s worth it. They come out perfect. Boil them for 10 minutes with a fuck load of salt and half tsp of baking soda (key ingredient). Drain em, toss them in the garlic and thyme infused olive oil you just made. Put them in the oven at 450 for about 45-hr, stirring/flipping once or twice. Bring em out, toss em in the dried garlic and thyme you strained from the oil. Pure potato bliss my dude."

Is there a difference in “Heavy Cream” and “Heavy Whipping Cream” if they are both labeled 36% milk fat?,"They are interchangeable, but read the rest of the label.

In the US, a lot of heavy creams have stabilizers like gellan gum, and the vast majority are UHT pasteurized.

The former will slightly impact baking characteristics and make whipping / emulsification easier, and the latter will impact setting characteristics in cheese, relative to 'normal' pasteurized or raw cream with its enzymes intact.  I don't think either change is completely prohibitive for most recipes, but they might need adjustment.

I wouldn't try making your own brie with UHT cream, but clotted cream worked fine for me, contrary to what a lot of articles say."
"When people fuck up the first pancake, are they not letting the batter sit long enough, or are they not heating their pan long enough, or something else?","it's a combination of heat and fat. Most pancake batter has melted butter or some other fat in it, which means it only needs enough fat in the pan to not stick.

Where people go wrong is they put too much butter on the griddle/in the pan, and you end up frying the first pancake rather than just cooking it. Furthermore, you need to rest the batter. This does two things: hydrates the flour and activates the chemical leavener. Both of those are chemical changes (starches and proteins do stuff in water), and both allow your pancakes to rise.

So combining unrested batter with too much fat in a too-hot pan results in a skinny, dense, greasy, gummy, burnt mess."

From that bechamel you can make a myriad of other sauces, but just focusing on mac'n''cheese, now you can sub other cheeses than the recipe just quickly reading up on which melt well. 

When you make a good mac, you only partially cook the pasta ahead of time, and finish cooking it in the sauce. Well hey, that's true for almost any pasta dish, so next time you make spaghetti, you know to not overcook the pasta.

Just keep learning the ""why's"" of recipes and you'll be able to apply them to other recipes for better results, or come up with your own."

"In the very high end fine-dining/michelin star restaurants, do the chefs measure out their spices exactly (quarter tsp of this, half a tbsp of that) to get every dish perfect, or do they tend to eyeball it and just add a little more if needed after tasting?","The thing is even the ingredients vary subtly in flavour or intensity. There are standard recipes but the the seasoned chefs typically eye ball it then taste later and adjust. Junior chefs, like myself, have to follow the recipe exact then get a seasoned chef to taste it. Then the juniors taste it to try and lock on to the correct taste profile.

I asked a restaurant for their soup recipe....and I don't understand it. Can someone help me figure out the steps?,"Is this a corn and chicken egg drop soup, Chinese? If I had to guess, the ounce of chicken cube is actually cubed chicken meat. In particular, chicken stock powder is not an uncommon Chinese ingredient (here, I’m familiar with a Knorr version that is not to be confused with a more “Western” chicken stock powder).

If so, I would make the soup by starting with 8 oz of chicken stock in the pot, adding the creamed corn, adding the chicken (and heating till it is cooked if the chicken was raw to start). Dissolve the cornstarch in a few tablespoons of cold water and mix into the pot, stirring to distribute evenly till the soup has thickened. Beat raw eggs till “scrambled”, and pour it into the soup in a thin stream whilst stirring to also distribute evenly and form the egg wisps. Finish with the seasonings. Order of seasonings probably don’t matter. And yes probably the broth/stock words used are interchangeable."

"We are John Becker and Megan Scott, co-authors of the 2019 edition of the Joy of Cooking. Ask us anything about the book or about cooking and food in general! We will also accept Thanksgiving-related questions :)","Hello! To the person who posted the first question (""what types of recipes needed the most revising?""), not sure what happened, but here's our answer:

It's hard to generalize with regard to recipe type. In general, the more complicated a recipe, the more motivated we were to update and improve it... Cassoulet and Seafood and Sausage Paella come to mind. We did not try to ""dumb them down,"" but the way they had been written in previous editions made them more complicated and inflexible than they needed to be.

We were also making more broad changes to different sections of the book. For instance, in the Vegetables chapter, we wanted to respond to the way people are cooking vegetables now. Back in the 70s (and before), folks were cooking vegetables to death. Then in the 80s and 90s there was a backlash, and ""crisp-tender"" became very popular. Now folks are kind of swinging back to the middle of the spectrum, acknowledging that, depending on the vegetable, they can be excellent crisp-tender or cooked beyond that.

Then there was the cake chapter. A lot of the older layer cake recipes had you separate the eggs, then beat the whites and fold them into the batter. We did a bunch of side-by-side tests on these cakes to see if whipping the egg whites was necessary. We found that the difference was minimal and that we preferred the cakes with whole eggs rather than separated ones. We think this is a preference that has changed over time: folks used to prefer lighter cakes, and now we like them a little richer."

They also have something they call an ""ion exchange resin"" to remove some heavy metals from the water.

If stock is anything like beer then the haze is largely proteins, which would need a very fine filter to remove. I would guess that a Brita filter **won't** do that.

Can’t eat immediately after cooking — common problem?,"Two things :

* Cooking is often hot, occasionally stressful work (especially if it's something ""nice"" for guests). This can definitely suppress your appetite. Try dishes that you can mostly prepare ahead of time and might only require a brief assembly or reheating before eating.

* You can get taste fatigue. Smelling, essentially, is tasting. You are smelling the food constantly as you cook. By the time it is done, you might be tired of it! Have you ever had someone walk into the kitchen and remark ""wow, that smells great!"" but you don't really smell a thing? That's exactly why. Being able to walk away from a meal before serving it, even for a few minutes, can make a big difference. Again, plan ahead so you don't need to constantly be in the kitchen right before the meal. Maybe ask someone else to stir something for a minute while you go set the table, or make something you can keep warm in the oven for a few minutes while you walk away before serving. (On a side note, this is why sandwiches actually do taste better when someone else makes them for you.)"
"I have EDS, a mandolin slicer, and zero adult supervision (yes I'm 26) -- need help finding a cut resistant glove/food gripper","Hi! I have hEDS too, and though my grip strength is alright I can still empathize with clumsy and awkward and stupid fragile skin.

Your basic [cut resistant gloves](https://nocry.com/products/nocry-microdot-cut-resistant-gloves) are a spandex-fibreglass-polyethylene weave. I've seen them in discount stores, so they're fairly affordable. They feel like a knit fabric, are flexible and grip quite well, and will protect you most of the time. You'll find that the mandoline will cut small slices in the fingertips of the gloves PARTICULARLY if the glove is too large for you, and they need to be washed (you can throw them in with your laundry) after using.

A slightly tougher option is the same glove but with a [polyurethane coating](https://www.werko.com.au/product/stealth-razor-cut-5-resistant-gloves) on the palm and fingertips. They feel a little stiffer, which could be difficult if grip strength is an issue, but the PU coating has more friction than the knit fabric of the first option so it's a trade off there. This style will last a bit longer before the cuts in the fingertips build up, but take a while to dry after washing so if you want to use them every day you may need more than one.

My personal favourite is an actual [steel mesh glove](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resistant-Stainless-Butcher-Cutting-Chopping/dp/B07FP5HYLH/ref=asc_df_B07FP5HYLH)! Not quite chain mail but it's tough, super easy to wash without starting a load of laundry, dries quickly and doesn't get stained or soggy the way knit gloves do. The downside is that they're a bit slipperier and you're supposed to wear a thin cotton glove inside them, though of course you can skip that. If planning to wear one without the cotton glove, go a size down.

Another suggestion just in general is to wrap a bandaid or a thin piece of strapping tape over the tip of the fingers on your slicing hand before putting the glove on. Mostly it's the first joint of your finger that's in danger with a mandoline. (EDIT: you can do strapping tape over your palm too, if slicing flat-handed.) It doesn't have any noticeable effect on grip strength, the bandaid can't fall into the food through the glove, and you get an extra layer of protection in case the blade gets through the glove. There are other options like [steel finger guards](https://au.grandado.com/products/4pcs-set-adjustable-stainless-steel-finger-hand-guard-finger-protector-knife-slice-chop-safe-slice-cooking-tools) but I really want my whole hand covered i.e. a glove when operating a mandoline.

All links are examples only, not purchase recommendations as I don't know where you live/what size hands you have/etc. Happy to help narrow it down to a specific affordable option once you know what you're looking for."

"Chineses dumplings - ""stir the meat in one direction"" - food science question - what is happening when you stir the meat in one direction?","The stirring in one direction is an old wives' tale/tradition to remind people to stir the mixture thoroughly in order to develop the correct texture. 

The science of it is that the action of manipulating the meat has real results. The mechanical process creates a sticky, cohesive filling. Its the difference between barely shoving meat together for the tender texture of a meatball vs. the other end of the spectrum, grinding meat for a snappy sausage. Mechanically working it starts to break down the protein structure, including one of the two major contracting filaments, the protein myosin, while squeezing out the trapped water. Myosin begins to coagulate at the relatively low temperature of 120ºF/50ºC which then leads to a more solid and firm texture in the end product. 

End result= dumplings work better with a stickier, developed filling."

Do spices actually expire?,"When we talk about expiration in food, there are 2 types of expiration: food safety expiration (typically worded ""use by"") and food quality expiration (typically worded ""best before"")

Most spices don't have a ""food safety"" expiration as they're, genetically speaking, not hospitable to bacteria and fungus which is what usually make people sick. They're even used as preservatives. 

What they do have is a ""food quality"" expiration, because they have volatile compounds that will disperse into the air (making the spice lose potency) and oxidize (making the spice taste off / rancid / lose color). That happens quicker when they're in powder form. Another thing that can happen is they can absorb moisture and cake into a super hard disk inside your jar, sometimes ""melt"" (usually things like bouillon cubes, premix and the occasional onion / garlic powder are prone to melting)

In your case, I recommend going through the cabinet and tossing everything that looks obviously moldy. Then do a color / sniff / taste test (IN THAT ORDER) of the test and see if it's still good / useable"
Keeping hands and cooking utensils clean while cooking,"There are a few techniques. First, they probably wash their hands more than they show on camera. Proper hand washing is a cornerstone of safe food preparation.

Second, one of the best ways to minimize the need for handwashing is to work in order from your ""least dangerous"" foods to your ""most dangerous"" ones. That means you start by prepping all your produce that's fine to eat raw before you start prepping your meats. And if you have multiple meats that you need to touch, you go in order of ascending final temperature (e.g. handle a steak or a piece of fish before you handle a chicken breast). You can still wash your hands between ingredients, but it's more for comfort and convenience than safety if you can stick to this pattern (sometimes it's inconvenient to do this way though, depending on the recipe).

NOTE: If everything is going to be cooked to a safe temperature, it's not all that important to avoid cross-contamination between different ingredients. But it's still a good habit to get into nonetheless.

Third, specifically around salt, most chefs are using loose salt rather than salt in a grinder. It happens to usually be Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, but any salt will do once you learn how much to use. With loose salt, you can easily pour some into a container to use for your recipe, and then discard what's leftover (or add the salt back into your container, since nothing will really grow on the salt itself). There is no benefit to ""freshly ground"" salt, since it doen't lose flavor over time after grinding.

Since pepper is best ground fresh (as are other spices), the most hygenic compromise between flavor and convenience is to grind a bunch of pepper (or the amount of a spice that you need) before you start cooking, and if you have any leftover after cooking discard what's left. That way you don't have to handle the grinder with dirty hands, but still have fresh pepper. And again, you want to try to season things in order from least to most dangerous. You don't want to touch chicken, then touch your pepper, then use that same pepper to season a salad."

A Cilantro Substitute Made By People Who Like Cilantro?,"My wife has the soap-gene and she says she can't taste the soapy-ness (and really enjoys what she can taste) when she has vinegar pickled cilantro. \[We found out because a farmer's market vendor was handing out samples of different naan-spreads and one of them was topped with a vinegar-y cilantro 'pesto' and to all of our surprise my wife loved it\]  


So maybe you can 'deactivate' the soap by soaking chopping cilantro in vinegar and then use that soaked cilantro in dishes where some extra acid wouldnt be bad?"
Is mixing spices before putting them on the food better than just sprinkling them one by one?,"As an Indian, I think I can add a little bit or a lot of depth to the discussion. We treat spices very differently compared to most cuisines. First of all, know what you want to do with the spices and what you want them to do for you. Same spice can give you very different flavours depending on how you treat it. For example, coriander seeds, toasted and ground, when added to fat and cooked at low temperature will impart an earthiness but smoke it high and it'll give you a smoky flavor. Toast it and cook it whole and you'll get a slightly different aroma with texture. And so on and so forth. Another example is fennel seeds. Toast it, grind it and add in a sauce on top. It'll give you a sweet cool aromatic finish on the palate. Compare that to fennel powder that is crushed without toasting. The sweetness of latter is more natural and not that concentrated. Compare still to fennel powder added during cooking process in a dish like roghan josh. The flavor is more complicated and hard. Similarly, prosciutto uses fennel powder at times as far as I'm aware but curing makes it taste very different. So on and so forth. 


So to sum it up, you've to learn to cook with spices. Figure out which ones you like the most and figure out which profiles you want to emphasize while cooking certain foods. That'll help you understand different stages at which you can add spices. To give you an idea, here are different ways to add spices to your food. 

1. Toast them, grind to a mix - you can use this mix as a seasoning or a rub for marinade. 

2. Add powdered or whole spices (procured from stores) to sauces with fat, sauté them to release aroma and cook sauce to finish. Examples include cloves, bay leaf, cilantro seeds etc.

3. Add spices before finishing to infuse the sauce with aromatics. Good example is saffron. Another is nutmeg or mace. Cooked too long, these spices will lose aroma. Cooked too little they can be too strong to be palatable. 

4. Add spices as finish. Examples include cumin powder, saffron (used correctly), cardamom, cinnamon etc.

There's a lot more to be said about spices. For example, grinding (in grinder) versus pulverising (in mortar pestle) and other minor considerations that become very prominent in traditional cuisines that use spices heavily.

Is adding vinegar to milk a good substitute for buttermilk?,"So I live somewhere (China) where buttermilk just plain isn't available. I've cycled through a lot of options - vinegar included - and my suggested substitute is yoghurt.

In an ideal world, first thing in the morning I take milk (for me, buffalo milk actually... it's local and can be delivered to my door, bog standard cow milk is also good though), toss a couple tablespoons of yoghurt in it, shake it up and leave it on the counter (I live in a subtropical climate, wherever in your house is warm is good). By the time I cook in the afternoon or in the evening, it's good to go and works quite well as a buttermilk sub. Or if you're making pancakes, you can do it at night and come to it in the morning.

As an aside, if you use cream (even UHT cream) and do the same thing for a full 24 hours, together with a tiny splash of vinegar to taste you can make a very convincing sour cream substitute. 

If you don't feel like going through that whole song and dance, you can also just use yoghurt straight up, though note that it'll have a bit more of that yoghurt-y tang to it. Usually still quite tasty, but would be a touch different of a flavor than the recipe writer was envisioning. 

[Stella Parks has a good writeup over on SE about some different choices](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/04/how-to-substitute-buttermilk.html), apparently her sub of choice was kefir. For me however, in order to get kefir I've gotta make it myself with the grains and all, which I just can't be bothered with."
how to elevate chicken soup from good to amazing,"Usually by the time you've extracted a fantastic broth from the chicken the meat itself is dry and has little flavour. Try adding some nicely seared and chopped chicken about half an hour before the soup is done to really elevate the chicken flavour in every bite.
Alternatively if you're using a whole chicken to make your soup, remove the breast and thigh meat prior to making your broth and then add them in near the end instead."

"If browning is caused by the Maillard reaction between sugar and protein, why does fat help browning and how can meat brown without any sugar in the pan?",Meats contain a natural sugar (Neu5Gc). Fat helps provide a more even temperature distribution
Question about shallots. How many shallots are in one... shallot?,"My non scientific answer is it doesn't really matter in practice. Just like with garlic and onion, doing a little more or a little less is not gonna ruin a dish. Just put what feels right!"
How do ramen restaurants keep the broth hot but not cloudy for serving?,"I used to work at a Japanese place that did ramen. We kept it in a bain marie, sort of like a soup kettle that kept it around 80'c  


So when you ordered your ramen, your noodles went into the water of the...noodle cooker, which is basically a big boiling water bath with baskets in it. whatever hot toppings you ask for go on the teppan grill. 3 minutes later, noodles come out, into the bowl, broth of choice goes over the top, then garnish with whatever you ordered."
"Is it possible to cook cranberries down in a way that results in a glaze-like syrup I could drizzle on a salad? No matter what I Google, all my results come back as holiday cranberry sauce.",I think its because cranberry is high in pectin. At least I’m assuming it is.  Since you dont need to add anything to make cranberry sauce. It sets up on it own. If it were me. Id juice the cranberries then make a reduction.

Look for one that has carrots in the ingredients. 
How to go about handing my recipe over to a possibly large company?,You should also contact a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights. Even if just for a paid consultation.
Why does restaurant butter (like from a steakhouse) taste so much better than butter I get at the store?,"What brands of butter have you tried?  I also think the European style butters taste better.  Also, are you letting your butter sit out and soften before you use it?  Food tastes different when its cold or straight out of the fridge."
Greek Potatoes,"I got you....

Quarter potato into flat baking dish. 
Single layer only ..

So for a rectangular plexiglass dish . 9x13?   I use 

Salt pepper and oregano

At least a cup of lemon juice and the zest of all the lemons.
 
1/4 cup or more EVO.. or other quality oil

Cover potatoes just barely with chicken stock.

Bake 350  - 400 degrees F until golden and liquids are just syrup."
Why should I heat up the pan 1st and then add oil?,"A few reasons:

1. Helps prevent burning your oil if you leave it on the heat.  The pan is hot, you put in the oil and pretty much immediately follow with food.  The food cools the oil and as it cooks and releases water content it regulates the oil's temperature.  If you leave oil alone in a pan as it's heating it's way easier to accidentally leave it and have it start smoking and polymerizing
2. Metal is porous and sometimes in certain types of pans (definitely happens in scratched up stainless steel pans sometimes) there can be moisture essentially trapped in the metal.  If you get the pan hot it will force that moisture to evaporate, but if instead there's a layer of fat on top of it, when it finally does get hot enough it can essentially ""explode"" (at a small scale) and splatter oil
3. If you are going for a really hard sear, such as with a steak, you can get the pan way hotter than you can get oil (or you want to get oil).  Example: Let's say you are searing a steak in a cast iron, which can hold a lot of heat energy.  You get the cast iron to say around 600F.  Add a touch of oil and immediately put the steak in.  The steak cools the pan but all that extra heat the pan had by being at 600 is going to make it so that it won't cool *too much* and will still be at searing temperatures of \~400F ideally.  However, if you had started with a cold pan with oil in it, by the time the pan gets to 400F the oil is at 400F and the oil starts smoking (depending on its smoke point and what kind of oil you're using).  This means you can't get the pan up to 600F because the oil will just be smoking itself to smithereens and will taste awful (and probably set off your fire alarm).  In this scenario it is better if your pan is somewhat over-preheated before you add the oil (be careful though, if your pan is significantly above the flash point of the oil you are using the oil could immediately ignite upon contact with the pan -- I have both seen others do this and done it myself in restaurants I've worked in when I left a pan on the french top too long before putting oil in it)"
How does steakhouses make their mashed potatoes SUPER silky smooth?,"Use a ricer. Mix as little as possible. And of course, more cream and butter than you can imagine."
What's the name of the white garlic sauce in Mediterranean bowls?,"It is indeed toum, but a lot of places use mayo or greek yoghurt to make it which gives it a completely different texture and taste. Some places also serve tzatziki. But the authentic version is indeed toum, which is just an emulsion of garlic and oil with salt."
Am I soup-sinning? Using bones from a rotisserie chicken in my soup,"No that's a super common method for quick stock making.

It's a lot harder to commit a soup sin than you might think. Half of the point of soup is to use up stuff you otherwise might not have a use for and turn it into something hearty and delicious. And it's a good way to stretch a buck.

You're just being efficient with your purchases and limiting food waste. No sane person would fault you for that."
Why are green peppers or toppings other than onions generally not considered normal to put on a Philly Cheesesteak?,"Some people are overly concerned with finding the 'most authentic' and original version of a foodstuff, then deifying it and gatekeeping other people's enjoyment of it. No food is authentic, everything has developed through cross pollination and evolution of tastes.

If it tastes good on it to you, that's all that matters. (Obviously there's a threshold- if you serve me roast pork with applesauce in a bun and tell me it's a cheesesteak I'll be disappointed. Where exactly that threshold lies is down to your own personal interpretation, not for someone else to tell you)"
Upgrading Soy Sauce,"[Yamashin Shiro Shoyu](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/white-soy-sauce-yamashin-shiro-shoyu) white soy is my crack.  At a mere £15.99 a bottle, my bellend of a boss would hide it from me even tho it was a key ingredient in my tuna tartare dish. I might have also been chugging it like it was a shiftie. Its the tits.

[Kishibori Shoyu](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kishibori-Shoyu-Pure-Artisan-Sauce/dp/B005GQYXTC) is nuts. Its fermented in 100-year-old cider barrels for a year. Not to be wasted on your average stir fry but treated more like you would an expensive olive oil or aged balsamic used only for plating.

For supermarket brands, San-J Tamari and Lee Kum Kee mushroom flavoured and dark soy are great cheaper buys. Lee Kum Kee is a Hong Kong brand that makes all kinds of great sauces and condiments."
Why do some people recommend to heat the empty pan before adding any fat ?,"It depends. For lower heats, it really doesn’t matter. However, if you’re at a higher heat, there is a good reason to add the fat in after the pan is heated: smoking. 

If you put the fat in a cold pan and heat it up to a high temp, there will be a long period of time when the fat passes it’s smoke point but the pan isn’t up to the desired temp yet. That whole time, the oil is releasing smoke in your kitchen. 

Alternatively, if you heat the pan to the desired temp and then add the fat, there might still be a period when it smokes. This time, however, it’s only the few seconds it takes you to put in the thing you’re cooking. And if you’re quick enough, you can even avoid that.

For example, when I stir fry, I first heat my wok up as high as it will go. Then, add some oil, swirl it around, and as soon as it starts shimmering toss in whatever I’m stir frying.

All this is dependent on the heat you’re turning the pan up to and the smoke point of the fat you’re using."
"Apparently olive oil or butter is common in tomato soup, what does it do?",Fats are an important part of many recipes. How are you making your tomato soup?
What does adding eggs one at a time do?,"I used to have to make a batch of eclairs once a week at work. You boil the water, add the salt and butter, melt, stir in the flour, move it to a mixing bowl, add eggs slowly, then form, and bake. Easy.

After I put in my 2 week notice I was showing someone else how to do the recipe. I explained that it's super simple, but finicky, so don't mess with the recipe or the method.

So we get to the adding eggs one at a time stage. We have 64 eggs shelled and in a pitcher. She adds the first egg, no problem. 5 seconds later, she adds the second egg, no problem. Then she tipped the pitcher and poured in half the eggs, so about 30 or so all at once.

The batter didn't have a chance to incorporate them, and became slippery. The blade for the paddle would slice through, followed by the raw egg, which would coat the strip of batter it just made with eggs, over and over again. After a few minutes of trying to get it to mix in, it looked like fat spaghetti noodles in a bowl of clearish gelatin. It did eventually mix in, but it took forever. And that batch of eclairs just didn't have the right mouth feel."
Why is this plate bleeding?,Because the glaze is cracked and it’s been absorbing water and gunk every time it’s been in the sink. The heat causes it to seep out.
Can I cook creme brulee in a large oven dish for just one time?,"You can totally do this. I think the biggest hurdle will be making sure the middle is set without overcooking the sides. I'd drop the oven temp by 15\* and bake longer, still in a water bath. And do a test before you make the real deal, so to speak.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Had to double check, internal done temp for creme brulee is 170-175F (77-79C)."

My prime rib “expires” on December 21st. Will it still be ok on Christmas? Should I follow a dry aging or dry brine process?,"That’s a “sell by” date, not an expiration date. Big difference. If it’s constantly kept below 41F, there’s very little chance it would go bad before Christmas in its original packaging."
Why does the taste of sesame oil overpower dishes when I cook at home vs ordering from a restaurant?,"There are 2 kinds of sesame oil - regular and toasted. 

Regular is light-colored (like canola or vegetable oil), has a pretty neutral flavor, and is commonly used as a cooking oil.

Toasted is dark brown, has a strong flavor, and is generally used in very small amounts as a finishing flavor.

My guess is you’re using toasted sesame oil as a cooking oil which means you’d have to be using too much."
What’s the best alternative to parchment paper for making cookies?,"Whatever you do, NOT wax paper. It will burn"
Why is it easier for a Japanese restaurant to get a 4.5+ star rating than a Thai place?,"Online reviews such as from Google and Yelp have lots of variability.  A lot of Asian restaurants in general have very swingy reviews because people with and without an understanding of the cultures will read things very differently.  For example, many great ""hole in the wall"" places get bad reviews from non-Asian eaters because of ""bad service"" - when the service is excellent... for Asian food values.  Deliver food when it's ready, piping hot, and clear away dirty dishes, bringing the check quickly - these are signs of efficient and great service at many Asian restaurants, but they can be off-putting to people accustomed to European dining, where you bring all plates out at once, course the meal, and let diners take their time before clearing the table or bringing the bill. 

There is also a lot of hype around Japanese food - especially Americanized sushi (mayo, massive rolls, lots of fried ingredients and spicy sauces) - so many restaurants (smartly) focus on presentation, which gets higher reviews from people who are looking for an experience, rather than an appreciation of traditional, quality Japanese food, which would seem bland and unexciting to many used to nontraditional versions.   

I always look at who is reviewing (what kinds of places they tend to like) and what they're saying about the place before weighting what they say.  I also check the menu to see what is being served - is it really Americanized, does it look like it appeals to the party crowd?  - to give context to what kind of place it is. 

Because of all these factors, it really won't make sense to compare ethnicity of restaurants and the reviews they get - different types of people go to these places, and the people rating have very diverse standards for what they're looking for."

"Why is yeast an ingredient in flat foods (ex: Saltine Crackers, waffer cookies, BBQ potato chips)? I thought yeast was just used to make food fluffy.",This is for taste.

How do Michelin Star restaurants make a profit?,i have to imagine they make absolutely absurd margins on the wine side.
Why do I need to use an entire pot of boiling water and how do I know when I can skip it.,"When you add food to boiling water, it brings down the water's temperature.  The temperature of a shallow pan of boiling water is going to be brought down much much more than the temperature of a large pot of boiling water because the shallow pan of water contains less total energy (I'm sure there's a more specific thermodynamic term for this. I tried googling, but I'm kinda out of my element).           


I believe that is part of why pasta packaging seems to suggest much more water than it seems is necessary.  If you have enough water, the water will come back to a boil quickly after adding pasta.  With less, it can take several minutes to come back to a boil.  How long it takes to come back to a boil can vary depending on the power of the stove, the material of the pan or pot, whether the lid is on the pot, etc.          
Using a lot of water evens the playing field and allows for more consistent result given all of the potential variables.

I am looking to replicate a delicious dish I had - pork belly with creamy jasmine rice - how to incorporate egg to get the rice creamy??,"There’s a similar Japanese dish called “Tamago gohan” which probably used a similar technique. Basically as soon as the rice is done, scoop some into a bowl and crack an egg into it, then stir vigorously to cook the egg with the hot rice. They may have only used yolks but you can use the whole egg."
"Boiled stock for risotto, dipped ladle and IT EXPLODED.","When materials undergo a phase change, the points at which the molecules go from one phase to another happen at ""nucleation points."" They're the points where it takes the least amount of energy to change phases, often pointed bits on the surfaces of the container. For example, beer glasses and champagne flutes are sometimes laser etched so the bubbles will form on the etching, instead of the sides of the glass.

When your stock was boiling vigorously, there was a ton of excess energy in the liquid, so really, any nucleation sites will work, not just the ones on the bottom of the pot where the heat source is. 

You added the ladle, which has a bunch of nucleation sites. This caused a chaotic chain reaction that would have settled down after a few seconds, even if you didn't turn down the heat.

"Many recipes recommend hand crushed canned tomatoes, but I've also heard that pre crushed canned tomatoes are actually picked riper because they don't need to maintain their shape at all. If this is true, why do most recipes avoid them?","The whole tomatoes tend to be higher quality fruit, since they have to actually BE whole once they’ve been canned. The crushed are more likely to contain  the bottom of the barrel bits. Tomatoes that were crushed during the process, etc. you’re really  just guaranteeing yourself a slightly nicer produce when using the wholes."
Mom wants a cheesy Mexican rice she had at Taco Viva. Some chain place 40 years ago,"So there is a [Taco Viva history page](https://www.tacoviva.com/index.html) and it even has a copy of the [menu](https://www.tacoviva.com/images/TVmenu87.pdf). Looking at that, the only rice is just a generic Mexican rice cooked with a sofrito base, and there was probably a little cheese mixed in.

Now, there are a lot of recipes for this kind of thing. Some of them are just, like, [rice with salsa and cheese mixed in](https://www.food.com/recipe/10-minute-cheesy-mexican-rice-132955), which is probably heresy to anyone who had an abuela that made Spanish rice from scratch. But it might be an accurate approximation of a side dish from a Florida fast food chain in the 80s.

"Whereas chicken nuggets are a mainstay of many fast food locations, why have I never even heard of ""beef nuggets"" made anywhere?", mmmm like tiny little chicken-fried steak bites!
Why is it safe to eat raw eggs in mayo or eggnog. But not on other things?,"1- The risk of Salmonella from raw eggs is extremely low, especially when combined with other antibiotic conditions (acidic mayos, alcoholic eggnogs, etc). 

2- Raw cookie dough contains raw flour, which is considered on average to be more dangerous than raw eggs since there have been numerous e. Coli and Salmonella outbreaks related to raw flour. 

TL;DR raw flour is the issue not raw eggs."

Is it better to get one AMAZING knife or a set of moderate but reliable knives?,"I am not a professional by any means, but I consider myself a pretty good home cook. I could get by with only two knives: a chef's knife and a serrated bread knife. I can mince an onion or any other vegetable extremely finely with a sharp, high-quality chef's knife. There are some specialty tasks you might need other knives for, like doing fine Asian-style fruit cutting or filleting a fish. But for cutting any sort of vegetable or meat, you really don't need much more than a chef's knife."

Does such a dessert exist?,Tres leches
I’m surrendering - simple dish has vexed me for YEARS. Chicken over potatoes,"So the ""broken down chicken on top"" may be a clue - if your host roasted the potatoes with the chicken on top (as I do) those spuds were roasting in chicken fat that dripped down on them, and that's how they tasted so good. I suspect your error is in thinking they're a different dish from the chicken.

Personally when I roast a chicken I do it on a bed of root vegetables (usually potatoes and carrots) in a cast iron skillet and they come out amazing from the fat they're cooking in."
Is there a type of cookie that only uses egg yolks?,"I've shared this link before, but [San Nicolas cookies](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/filipino-desserts) are made with egg yolks, because the egg whites were needed for architectural reasons. It's not what you're probably looking for, but it's fun to know that there are tons of ways that surplus egg yolks can be used!"
Why do so many places serve shrimp dishes like shrimp pasta with the tails still on?,"Mostly for presentation, without the tails the shrimp look tiny and curl up a bit more. The tails also are like a little handle/piece to grab when picking up the shrimp to eat when using your hands instead of a fork. Pick up shrimp by the tail, dip in sauce, bite at base of tail, then discard the shell. If you are opposed to the tails in your dishes, kindly request no tails/shells when ordering. Most kitchens would be happy to oblige (I got this request at my seafood restaurant every so often.)

Edit:  fine maybe not so happy, but yes to the oblige. "
How to peel a LARGE amount of garlic,"Here’s how we do it in prep kitchens:

Smash all the heads into individual cloves and put them in a container that will also hold water. 

Go to your kitchen sink and turn on the hot water. Let it run until it gets too hot to put your hands under, like a full minute or two, and then cover the unpeeled cloves in hot water and put it on the countertop.

Let it sit until the water is at room temperature, then go ahead and drain the container. The cloves will now be easy to peel.

I typically take a small paring knife and cut off the ugly bit at the root, cutting through the clove but not through the “back” side of the skin. Then, in one motion, you can grab the skin between the knife and your thumb and peel it all off. 

I can get through a case of garlic with this method in about 25 minutes. Also, your hands will smell like garlic for about 4 days. 

Best of luck."

Accidently added 2 sticks of butter to a cake recipe. It came out pretty good. Why wasn't it ruined?,"People are saying “butter is good” and that’s absolutely true but I think the reason the cake came out fine (though I’m assuming a little oily) is because more butter = denser cake, not ruined cake. Brownies have a lot of fat and so does pound cake. Sponge cake has very little fat.

Obviously there are other factors contributing to this (literally all the other ingredients), but I would hazard a guess that it’s mostly just the density that changes."
Anytime I cook garlic in oil over medium heat it burns instantly. How come recipes keep telling me to do this?,"You're cooking it over high heat. You think it's medium, perhaps because it says ""medium"" on the knob. But your stove's knobs don't mean anything. Nobody's knobs mean anything. They might as well be written in Egyptian hieroglyphs."
"Has anyone noticed that crushing garlic into a paste in a mortar and pestle, vs mincing/grating it, it becomes incredibly mild and sweet to the point of being usable as a spread?

Why the hell can't I sharpen my knife?,Hit the edge on each side with a layer of sharpie and then try again. That will help you know where you're making contact between the blade and the stone. If that doesn't diagnose the problem then perhaps you aren't sharpening to a burr. You want to sharpen enough that a wisp of metal peeks over the tip of the blade.
Why is butter deemed healthier than margarine even though it contains a lot of saturated fats?,"It's a rebound from the great lipid scare of the 70s and 80s.

I can do pages on this.  But in short cardiac problems use to be linked to dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol.  People moved to margarine which for manufacturing reasons contained a lot of trans fats.  And it was cheaper, and the government was pushing it.  I will try to avoid discussing how much politics played in all of this.

In short, turns out ratios of short chain, medium chain and long chain triglycerides is more important.  Butter ain't bad in that category."
Do you reuse oil after deep frying ?,"Yes, for future deep frying. Strain out any bits that get left in it and store in a sealed container. You should be able to get several uses out of it.

The exception is seafood, which can transfer fishy flavors to the oil that you might not want to end up in the next thing you fry."
Starting culinary school in my 30’s,"If you have never worked in a restaurant, go do that before you commit to culinary school and this as a career. Cooking at home bears no resemblance to cooking professionally. The hours are long, the money sucks, you'll be away from family on holidays, its massively male dominated, line cooking will make 35 feel like 75 as you compete against 18 year olds who live on energy drinks and nicotine and this world wide plague has utterly crushed the industry.

"What does washing rice actually *do*, and when to apply/not apply?","There is no one hard and fast rule or reasoning for any or all rice- different varieties, different applications, different cultures all impact if rice gets washed/aka rinsed/soaked/tossed into a pot as is, etc.

* Where the rice is from and how it is stored may dictate that it gets washed to remove detritus of the packaging or storage process, remove dirt or other impurities, etc., not just starch. My Singaporean step mother kept the rice in a garbage bag in a huge bucket in the garage. That shit got rinsed.

* If the end result desired is rice that does not clump it gets rinsed- often sushi, jasmine, etc. One of the biggest complaints is people getting mushy results from a high end rice cooker and when you drill down, you find out they don't rinse their rice. [Watch a YT of an expert sushi rice maker](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hsBHBMrm-wg&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE) and you'll see that sushi rice ain't no joke.

* Method of cooking can also impact if it gets washed or soaked. A lot of dishes that use basmati call for soaking the rice. I am sure someone more knowledgeable when it comes to basmati will come thundering out of the bush to add to this.

* For congee or risotto, two very different types of rice but both starchy applications, do not get washed [unless impurities are a concern.]  Starch release is a big part of what makes both wonderfully creamy.

* Having grown up around the world, culture plays a big part in how we deal with food [see also every damn post about washing chicken] but Asian cultures tend to wash/soak, etc. their rice more than people who grew up in families that eat rice once in a blue moon. I first ate rice in Texas where it was served wet, with a pat of margarine and no salt. My mother could rock out tamales but rice? The rice gods should have struck her down."

Why aren't there more spices?,"There's  [lots of spices and spice blends](https://foodal.com/knowledge/herbs-spices/guide-reference/). I'd start looking at [international cuisines](https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-virgin-us&source=android-browser&q=International+recipes+By+country&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXzp3025fsAhUSS60KHSwLDzkQ1QIwFXoECB4QOQ&biw=360&bih=616&dpr=2) and see how they are utilized by various regions with different ingredients, preparation methods, etc.

As a general rule ""if no cuisines use it it's probably poison"""
How does one make fried mushrooms that are more crispy and firm?,"When you first start cooking them, add water rather than oil (seriously, I know it sounds dumb but it helps with flavor). Add some salt. Then, cook them. TONS of water will come out. Your mushrooms will be swimming. Keep cooking.

Once most of the water evaporates, add a bit of oil and taste for seasoning. Keep cooking until they brown. You can burn them, but otherwise basically cannot overcook them (they’ll never get mushy from too much cooking)."
What do you do with soup you intend to eat across 3 days? Why?,"No one else seems to be biting on the actual food safety issue at hand, so I’m going to address one aspect. 

You mentioned that you “bring the soup to a boil to kill off anything that may have developed in it.” With food poisoning the concern isn’t always that you’ll be infected with live bacteria. There is also the issue that when food sits out in the “danger zone” bacteria can infect it, then multiply and *release waste products* that are toxic and that can’t be destroyed by heat. This is the risk that you run by repeated heating and cooling the same dish. Personally I would divide it into 3 separate portions that you can reheat rather than going to the trouble of making one portion per person, since it seems you’ll be reheating them at the same time anyway."
Is lamb generally considered fancy in most countries or is it an American thing,"It's more expensive because its not as much of an industry here, so there isn't as much of it available."

I caramelized four pounds of onions down to a spread. Could I freeze it in cubes for longer storage?,"Short answer, yes.

Long answer, when the cubes are frozen pop them out and seal them in a ziptop bag or similar to reduce the exposure to air in the freezer."
Best cookbooks for classic American style Chinese takeout food?,"Damn commenting because I want this too. I hear too often that Chinese ""take out"" is ""not good"" or ""not authentic"" but damnit, just like anything else it has its proper place. I want authentic Chinese takeout.

Edit: don't know if this is the best, but I'm gonna try this one -- Diana Kuan The Chinese Takeout Cookbook: Quick and Easy Dishes to Prepare at Home

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sa9nYKiYg0"
What foods should I not freeze?,"Any watery fruits and vegetables don’t freeze well, like cucumber, watermelon etc. Because of their high water content, freezing them changes their structure significantly and affects the taste/texture when thawed. You’re basically breaking apart the structure when you freeze them and then expect them to go back to the original structure when you thaw them out again. If you’re using some things like frozen strawberries frozen, like in a smoothie, it should be fine."
What's the name of the really crunchy fries you typically get hole in the wall spots? How are they made to be like that?,I'm a chef and I buy these for my kitchen.

What's the proper dining etiquette for when you're eating spicy food and snot starts pouring out of your face?,"Miss Manners and Dear Abby both agree that it's a natural response (""gustatory rhinorrhea"") and fine to do at the table as long as you're not being gross or loud about it. If a cloth napkin is all that's there, go for it, I guess. If they serve food they know is going to make people's noses run, they should know they're going to end up with snot on their napkins."
Is there a name for eggs that have been cooked sunny side up but covered so the top turns white?,"Yeah, those are called basted eggs. But in a restaurant they will use water to steam the tops. Basically the same end result, but faster. I worked in a breakfast diner for years, this is how we made ""basted"" eggs, when ordered. 

And before anyone tries to correct me by saying basted eggs are when you spoon hot butter/oil over the eggs as you cook them, as you would a steak, you are also correct, but in the context of eggs, there are two different meanings for the same term."
"would it go well if you replaced the water in a bread recipe with chicken stock? or like, added powdered bouillon to the dough?","Someone here replaced the water with Gatorade and they loved the result so I say what the hell, give it a shot.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask but why do I only see raw walnuts in stores? Why are all other nuts available roasted and salted except walnuts?,"Toasted nuts actually go rancid faster than raw nuts. Walnuts go rancid faster than other nuts because they have the highest polyunsaturated fat content by almost double or triple other commonly sold nuts. So roasting them compounds the speed of them going rancid. You can find them roasted/salted but they’re much rarer to find than like say, peanuts or almonds."
What is the substance seafood restaurants give you to dip crab meat into that they call “butter”?,Clarified butter.
Are the red beans found in Japanese deserts the same as the dried red beans found in a supermarket here in the US,"Look for Adzuki beans at an Asian market. 

They’re red beans, but about pea sized, round, and has a white line on one side.  It’s usually found dry in a package, and to make the bean paste, you add some sugar to sweeten it.  I’ve also seen them in cans.  

Another way to eat them is in rice called Osekihan.  It’s red beans and rice, and it’s delicious!"
"If bread flour is higher protein, why is the nutrition label the same as AP flour?",[deleted]
Why does Greek yogurt start becoming watery only after you open it? Is there any way to prevent it?,"The cultures in yogurt create lactic acid which causes the casein micelles (protein aggregates) in the milk to destabilize and form a matrix trapping water molecules and fat globules into a gel. When you open your yogurt and dig a spoon into it you disturb the matrix and release some of that trapped water. The best thing to do is just pour off that collected water every time you go for more yogurt. Stirring is the worst thing you can do to preserve the thickness, more matrix disruption = more liquid released."

My cooking profesor said my dish was too flat.,"Take the potato out of the salad. 
Make a nice warm potato salad with leeks, put a round down and smash the potato salad into it to make a nice circle, place your meat on that, drizzle the sauce around. If you still want freshness with the strawberry that's cool, make your salad smaller cuts and tighter, add some toasted nuts or something for texture  more like a slaw that compliments the dish rather than a ""side"""
Flour Moths,"Oh, please don't get used to it. They don't just live in flour, they live in chocolate and nuts and all kinds of things. They form webs and have little maggots and are NOT normal.

"When I was in 5th grade I developed an intrest in cooking and told everyone I was gonna be a chef. Fast forward into my twenties, I persued a major in psychology and midway, I am realizing that cooking may have been my real passion. My question is what do I need to become a decent self taught chef?","Just so you're aware of what being a professional chef is like.
I recently met with a chef that's been in the industry for 40+ years and what he said really changed my mind on becoming a chef.

Expect to work 18 hour days when things get hectic.

Weekends no longer exist.

If you're really lucky you'll get 2 days off per week, otherwise it'll be 1.

Your social life is in the kitchen.

If you get married it's almost always to someone who works alongside you because you often do not have the free time to date outside your direct industry.

""At the end of your 3 years study you will not be a chef, you are on the bottom rung until you can prove yourself, and that takes time. You are unlikely to be ready to be a competent head chef in your first 7 years in the industry, your qualification doesn't get you a ticket to the top, it just means you can cook"".

The kitchen always comes first.

Your lower back and feet take tremendous strain. Fuck either up and you're out of the job.

The pay is shit. Expect minimum wage until you've proven yourself. And once you've proven yourself don't expect anything fancy until you reach the top.

Get used to stress.

You will have to interact with customers, take their shit, and their compliments. You must remain composed throughout.

This isn't to scare you from the industry, it's just to lay bare what the ""norm"" can be like when working in a restaurant etc.
Obviously like all industries there are awesome gigs that have great hours etc, strive for that, but don't expect it.

Obviously none of this really applies if you just want to be good at cooking and maybe do something like a catering business/YT channel."
"How to Deal with the general workings of a large wooden cutting board, and how to clean as you go","I have 2-3 towels at a time in the kitchen and probably 20 in my linen closet. 1 for drying clean dishes, and the others for wiping my hands, cutting board, etc. As it gets dirty, I’ll swap it for a new one if needed. Towels go in the laundry and wash with bleach. I wash my board with soap and water every time I use it then oil as needed. It is a bit clunky but I’ve gotten the hang of it by now."
Is there a secret to peeling the first papery layer of an onion?,You’re fine and not alone.  Just go straight to peeling that extra layer off.  Onions are cheap enough it’s not worth the hassle to get it exact.  Also sometimes that extra layer is kinda dried out anyway.
Cooking food to be eaten on an aeroplane!,"I worked for an executive jet catering company for a couple of years. My advice would be: 


-tomato sauces good, cream sauces bad
-leave everything slightly underdone if you’ll be reheating on board. 
- spiced food is excellent. 
-add 10-15% more salt than you would at ground level
-don’t have eggs
-vinegar, lemon and lime are your best friends. 
-use a slice of butter on top of any meat or vegetables you’re going to reheat, it should melt over and keep everything moist"
How do I serve fresh pasta to big groups?,"You can hold fresh pasta for a few hours at room temp, or fridge it if you are really concerned. Otherwise, it really depends on which particular dish you are serving. You can make lasagna a day in advance, stuffed fresh pasta/dumplings freezes and cooks from frozen beautifully, and otherwise, just make a giant batch, nest, dust, and fridge if you are worried about it sitting out too long."
"Coronavirus concerns - given that people are asymptomatic for a while, they could be touching produce and putting back what they don’t want. How should I clean the produce? Run it through water only or something else?","The coronavirus does not spread through food:

my dad gave me 12 pounds of dried of dried cherries.... What do I do with them?,"You are living a life I can only dream of. If I had 12 pounds of dried cherries I would eat 12 pounds of dried cherries and die happy. Anyways, they are great in granola, fruitcakes, chicha morada, and chocolate bark. You can also make something like [this](https://fortheloveofcooking.net/2013/09/wilted-spinach-with-dried-cherries-and-pine-nuts.html), or rice pudding."
What's the difference between using lime (green colored) and lemon (yellow colored) in my food?,"Food science answer: They have very extensive volatile flavor differences. Both contain relatively the same concentration of citric acid in their juice, so there won't be much of an acidity difference. It comes down to the flavor that each brings. Lemons contain higher concentrations of ""light"" and ""candylike"" flavor compounds (aldehydes like citral and terpenes like pinene) which is why they are used more often to ""lift"" or "" brighten"" dishes, where lime has many more ""heavy"" and ""floral"" flavor compounds (like fenchyl alcohol and terpineol) that can complement and cut through many strong flavor profiles. Cuisine plays a huge part to be sure, but both play different roles in adding acidity to various dishes."
why do chefs make their pans catch fire,"It depends on what's cooking. Flambéing is just a part of cooking with high levels of alcohol. 

As for accidentally setting pans on fire that can easily happen when the flames gets too high in a pan heavy with oil or grease. People here can act like a true chef would never do that, but these people have never had to watch 12 burners while trying to fit enough food for 50 simultaneous customers on a Saturday night with a full house.

It happens, you put the fire out and 99 times out of 100 nothing is ruined. And if it is ruined chances are it was ruined well before the pan caught on fire."
"Who uses curly parsley, when flat-leafed is as available, and why?","As a chef, I can tell you curly parsley is 1000% easier to finely chop"
Does pure vanilla bean taste good?,"I’ve done this myself with a small amount of vanilla bean last time I was using it. It tastes like bland vanilla. Less bitter than vanilla extract, but there’s none of the sweetness or saltiness that usually rounds out the vanilla flavor in desserts.

So I guess I’d lean toward it not really being edible a la vanilla extract."
"Cooked a whole chicken with potatoes, onions and carrots in a dutch oven. Can I achieve the same taste by doing it again without the meat ?","Probably not exactly, but you can likely experiment  with a few things that might move you in the right direction. The chicken is adding a few things:

1. Umami flavor. To replace this, you probably want to add at least one umami-heavy ingredient, like some tomato paste or marmite.
2. Gelatin. The fact that you described the veggies as caramelized indicates that most of the water in the pan evaporated and you got some nice browning. In meats, it's mainly proteins that are browning; in vegetables it's mainly sugars. That sort of sticky browning flavor might be in part due to browning of the gelatin that comes out of the chicken as it cooks. So maybe bloom some unflavored gelatin in your chicken stock before using it, so there will be proteins that can brown.
3. Fat. The chicken skin renders and releases schmaltz. There's no other flavor quite like schmaltz, but you can replace it with another fat that will serve the same function for browning purposes and add a flavor of its own. I would *not* go with something totally neutral like canola oil...if you're gonna add fat, might as well go with something that will add good flavor like olive oil, butter, or ghee.
4. Water. The chicken will release some moisture as it cooks. You may find that you need to increase the amount of chicken stock you use if you aren't using the meat. I think adding wine is a good move because it adds more sugars that can caramelize a bit, and also adds acidity that can offset all the richness. HOWEVER, know that browning won't really happen until the water evaporates, so you don't want too much liquid.

It likely won't come out perfectly the first time as you tweak the different variables, including the above plus what vessel you cook it in, how much time they spend covered/uncovered,  and what temperature you cook in."
How is it that adding powdered sugar to cream cheese when whipping somehow makes it *more* fluid?,"Sugar is hygroscopic, which basically means it draws water to itself.  It's pulling the water out of the cream cheese, and then it dissolves in that water.  Yeah, it's pretty wacky.

Bakers consider sugar to be a ""wet"" ingredient when working out ""wet"" v. ""dry."""

The Mystery of the Fun Dip Stick,"Sugar, flavor, binders, bit of moisture, a two sided stainless form, and a industrial press than can produce extremely high pressures.

The ingredients are the easy part, it's the press that's the hard part. Small scale presses are highly restricted due to the fact that they are commonly used to produce illicit drugs (ecstacy pills, xanax counterfeits, etc). The most common excuse and how they are sold out of China is ""candy presses"".

You may be able to finagle something out of a vise and appropriate one-off form, that's probably your best option. Trying to produce in volume with proper equipment however... may get you some phone calls and visits from men in uniform."
At my restaurant we are not utilizing our duck carcasses. What are some specials I can do with this. I've tried foie gras or making a stock for the risotto tha goes with our duck but my chef isn't sold. I need an idea to show my chef that we can do something delicious with it.,"Thats depressing.  At the very minimum should be roasting the carcasses and using them to make a duck sauce.  Can also make duck rillette which is pretty easy, just slow cook and mix it all up.    Can do a little quinelle with whatever you serve the breast with.  Or serve it with charcuterie if you sell that. 

Or even something fun like a duck croquette. 

Either way tell your chef a stranger on the internet thinks he's stupid for throwing away stuff that is so useful."

Is culinary school helpful for becoming a personal/private chef?,"I’ve been almost exclusively a private chef for the last 15 years- yachts, homes etc. most staffing agencies and personal assistants prefer it on your resume, probably 80% of them.

I Drunkenly bought 10 pounds of citric acid,"Are you a fan of cheese dips and sauces? You can convert some of the citric acid into to sodium citrate for some very easy cheese sauces. It won't use a ton, but it is progress.

Just mix 97 grams of baking soda and 74 grams of citric acid in 125 grams of water in a non reactive pot. Wait for the reaction to completely finish, this can take a couple of hours and the pot will get pretty cold during the reaction. It makes CO2 and water, just like vinegar and baking soda, but leaves behind a solution of sodium citrate. Boil off the water to get powdered sodium citrate.

To make use of it, warm a small amount of milk, water, beer, or your base of choice. Weigh out the cheese you plan on melting and dissolve approx 2 to 3 percent of that weight to the warmed liquid. Then just add the cheese in small chunks, stirring to incorporate it. It melts like velveeta, but tastes of real cheese.

[Or you can try some Mac and cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/11/sodium-citrate-baked-mac-and-cheese.html)"
"Why is puff pastry the universally accepted prepackaged ingredient that is not considered ""cheating"" at cooking?","Not much difference in quality premade versus making it from scratch or it’s just not worth the time. There are plenty of other things that fall into this category as well. Condiments and such. Like, could you make your own mustard? Yeah but you’re not going to."
"What is in things like raw garlic, mustard, horseradish, etc. that give them a spicy bite?","In hot mustard, it's allyl isothiocyanate.

A kind of interesting thing: tolerance for capsaicin and tolerance for allyl isothiocyanate are entirely separate and unrelated. Thus, there are people who can eat insanely hot chilis but can't eat English mustard, and vice-versa; since they operate on totally different receptors tolerance for one does not translate to the other at all."
How do you grate the last part of the cheese?,Just eat it
Can you make chicken stock with raw bones?,"If you put the bones in raw, they will make what is known as white chicken stock and it will have a lighter, more delicate flavor.  If you roast them first they will make brown stock, which has a more robust flavor.  Which one you want really depends on the type of soup you're planning on making."

How do I cook chicken thighs like the ones at Indian restaurants/Hawaiian bros?,"Lots of Indian chicken is marinated in yogurt (along with salt and the spices) for a good long while. Like 8+ hours.

Did I just ruin this cast iron skillet before ever using it?,"Your pan is fine. it's basically impossible to ruin a cast iron pan. For some reason, Reddit think's that you need to go though some kind of elaborate process when, frankly, you're going to get exactly the kind of performance and non-stick you want/need by using the pan for days/weeks/years. 

Forget about 'seasoning from scratch' or whatever. Use you pan normally and if you can cook a little fatty food (like bacon) even better. When it's done, scrub it clean with hot water and a brush or sponge. Instead of drying it with a dish towel, stick it on the range and heat it up to dry it . When the water from rinsing it has steamed off and dried, wipe a little cooking oil on it with a paper towel while the pan is still hot and let it come down from temperature. Use this pan as your daily driver for basically everything and you'll have a no hastle non-stick surface before you know it."

How does pairing a food with a beverage work?,"I’m not a sommelier, but I am a chef. Usually the higher end pairings are not done solely by the chefs, so take this with a grain of salt.  That being said:

It’s really a lot of fun tasting foods and wines/beers/cocktails together, and the best way to determine the ultimate pairings is really trial and error.  

Some good guidelines are to pick a beverage that won’t overpower your food.  A delicate fruit pastry is not going to pair well with a big, fat, juicy red wine, but will go wonderfully with some more crisp whites or late harvest wines.

This can go both ways too.  A really fatty cut of red meat (ribeye or the like) is going to completely drown out a subtle white varietal, but will work in fantastic harmony with an old world red, or something comparable.  

Just as with anything else, there are exceptions to these rules as well.  Cured beef or ham goes great with any good European table wine (good luck getting any outside of Europe unfortunately), and some desserts are best eaten with port or sherry (dark chocolate or toasted nut-centric desserts).

In the end, it’s really all about what you like.  I personally love a glass of gewurtztraminer with a slice of pizza, but that kind of thing might get me laughed out of any serious wine conversation."

It’s my favorite squash (never thought I’d have a favorite squash), goes great with feta and can easily be its own meal in my opinion."
"Throwing out water that was used to boil chicken, is it necessary?","It's a common technique in making Cantonese soups. After throwing away the initial greyish water, add new water and simmer. The resulting broth will be relatively clear and lighter, some say it has a ""cleaner"" taste.

Does celery root have anything in common with milk?,"I had to do a deep dive into McGee’s *Nose Dive*. It’s hard to find anything conclusive, but it might be that you’re especially sensitive to the phthalide lactones in both (or desensitized to everything else). Phthalide lactones, especially sedanenolide, contribute heavily to the aroma of celery. Lactones, as their name suggest, are also a constituent of milk, and I’m willing to bet phthalide lactones, or at least close cousins, are also in milk as part of its grassy aroma. There’s probably some neurological mix-up happening as well that’s making your brain associate the two, or at least is mentally categorizing them closer than normal. Let me know if you have more questions and I can see if I can find the answers!"

[Paprika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika#History_and_etymology)

So it appears it is the same story as with cayenne, even with Columbus, just different routes of initial popularity. Paprika went though Spain to eastern Europe where it exploded in use and spread like wildfire after hitting Britain and France.

You got two versatile peppers that bring heat and a fruity flavour that activates a lot of sensors of the mouth and tongue. It just tastes good to us as a species."
Received a 7kg prosciutto. No idea what to do with it.,"Wow- serious gift congrats. 

It has a longer shelf life, they are intended to be aged. Your biggest issue will be cutting it without damaging/wasting it. If you don’t have a deli slicer you may need to look into a stable wooden mount that you could use a super sharp blade on. 

Personally I would hang it and not even think of opening it before figuring out a plan for slicing it. 

Have a party and put out a lot of prosciutto with cheeses to enjoy. That’s a lot to go through,, will go a long way.

Does making making pastes with a pestle and mortar really improve the flavour in a dish that is going to be cooked?,"It depends on the ingredients..

english name for lemon bao?,I've never seen one filled with a lemon filling. But the base bun is called a buo luo or pineapple bun (no relation to pineapple flavor).

Looking for ideas for repurposing a mountain of bloomed chocolate.,"Hear me out: chocolate solera river. You'll be required to install a trough around the perimeter of your chosen room, but for dramatic effect I'd go straight through it with clear piping with open notches periodically at the top. We'll call them ""snacking ports"" ideally on a hinge you can open and close to keep debris or german children out.

You'll also need some heaters and a pumping mechanism like a screw auger. It can run indefinitely with periodic additions of more chocolate and small amounts of coconut oil which, when gently heated, will help keep things flowing smoothly. Perhaps some anti-oxidants to stave off some of the oxidization over the years, but that also brings us to the *solera* part of the chocolate solera river.

In distilling/brewing, there is a solera concept where you continuously add distillates to the same container for aging and use. e.g., you add your first year's rum, then your second year's, and now you have a blend of rum that's between 1&2 years old. You keep doing this year after year until you have a smoothly blended rum with the harsh notes from the yearly rum you're adding diluted and mellowed by the years before. For a chocolate solera you'd be reversing this, with the fresh chocolate additions diluting anything that's become oxidized."
Should a restaurant devein shrimp?,"Shrimp should be deveined. 

The poop toob often will contain sand. 

If you do not plan to devein your shrimp, look for purged shrimp. Unfortunately most fish mongers don't know if their shrimp are purged or not, but you can tell if you look closely at the shrimp if their bodies are translucent enough. 

If most of the shrimp have dark heavy poop chutes, they're not purged.

Purging is a process where live caught shrimp are kept in circulated water for something like 12hrs. The hold period gives the shrimp time to poo which saves you from having to devein."
Why does my extra food that I freeze lose taste and texture when compared to frozen food I can buy from a grocery store?,Food frozen commercially is often flash frozen which leads to less deterioration in quality due to less/smaller ice crystals forming inside the food. These ice crystals rip apart the cells in your food reducing quality.
"My Father can't admit his french fries sucks, need help.","Double-frying is a better option, though it will take planning - and space.

Ideally, you need 2 fryers. One at 325F, one at 350F. Fry a batch at the lower heat until soft, then take them out & let them cool. Then finish them off at the higher temp.

Basically what this does is the 1st fry heats up all the water in the potato. the cooling lets all that water emerge & evaporate off. Then the 2nd fry crisps the outside - but all the water is gone so when you take them out to serve, that water isn't escaping & turning them soggy.

So to do this, you need to plan your batches...and have the space to lay the fries out to cool (they shouldn't be just tossed in a bowl because they won't cool fast enough & the potato starches will make them all stick together)

Edit: Just noticing you're boiling first. And that's a problem, since you're literally adding in a bunch of water that then steams off when you take them out of the fry oil & makes them soggy."
I don’t understand Al Dente,"Nah, I think you're absolutely right. It varies person to person. Some people like it almost with a dried bit in the middle that sticks to your teeth, where as some do it as its barely not mush. You can also have al dente referred to in the sense of rice, such as arbrorio used in risotto. 

Imo, fresh pasta is kinda where it all came from. There are different margins for each medium. But I feel the one you can most easily keep checking, and tell the difference, is fresh pasta. There's a pretty specific point where it doesn't stick to your teeth, but also isn't mush. Amd within that window there's a few different points. And imo, that is al dente. At which point, to each their own.

I've found that with dried pasta, if you boil it till close to the stick to your teeth point, and then turn it off and let it sit for a few minutes, it gets pretty evenly al dente.  

Imo, its meaning that its not gonna just mush when you bite it. Theres a resistance, but without the dried or stick to your teeth.  

Imagine a perfectly cooked vegetable. Its not crunchy, its not mushy, its ""al dente""."

"What makes a palate cleanser capable of cleansing palates? And what happens, chemically speaking, when a palate gets cleansed?","When eating savoury dishes, two things happen, an abundance of salt dulls the palate and fat coats the tongue, inhibiting the ability to distinguish flavours. Something mildly acidic, and usually a bit sweet, will cut thru this and re-set the palate. Thats why lemon sorbet is a frequent popular option for a palate cleanser.

Ask any cook who is tasting the same dishes over and over again in a professional setting and they'll tell you all about palate fatigue. I frequently have to ask someone else to taste a dish because I can no longer taste something rich and salty after a while- especially a thick, salty sauce. A quick chomp on a lemon wedge is the way I get my ability to taste back when working the line."
"I made potato, leek soup. What can I do to ""bring more to the table""?","Leek and potato soup is one of my favourites. Generally I jazz it up with toppings like:

- fresh chives
- dollop of sour cream
- shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- fresh croutons

And always some freshly ground black pepper!"
Tapioca pearls: how do you get the perfect sweetness and consistency?,"I worked at a bubble tea shop for a couple of years so here's my two cents:

- After you finish cooking the boba, make sure you thoroughly rinse it in cold water until they are no longer hot. Aim for a temperature of a less than lukewarm, but not ice cold. This process helps retain the ""qq"" or chewy texture and prevents your bubbles from getting too soft.

-Use a lot more sugar than you think you need!!! We used something like a 1:4 ratio of brown sugar( honey works great as well) to water to soak our bubbles in. After about 30 minutes, the bubbles taste their best. They should've absorbed most of the sugar at that point, while retaining the texture.

- The 5 minute instant cook boba from the local Asian grocery store are fine, but I've been using those since I was a kid and I could never recreate store bought taste & texture. It may be worth trying to make homemade tapioca(working on this myself!) pearls or buying store quality boba like this one: https://www.amazon.com/Tea-Zone-Tapioca-Bag-Pound/dp/B007LA06Y2
If you do buy this brand, you'll notice that these bubbles crumble which is more similar to homemade/fresh bubbles as opposed to the store bought bubbles that are drier and harder

I hope this helps a lil :)

Edit: 
One more quick tip! 
If you tends to clump together, I suggest that during the rinsing process you use your hand to separate the boba. You want to squeeze the boba, like you're grabbing a stress ball, and it will separate the boba. You can use a spatula to do the separation, but I find using your hand to separate the bubbles works the best.

~please don't burn yourself, only start separating when the bubbles have cooled a bit~"
"If I add xanthan gum to Tabasco, will I get a more wing-friendly sauce?","You have to emulsify the tobasco, or any sauce works really... It's easy.

What's the science behind letting the flavors getting to know each other?,"Different flavors are soluble in different liquids. For example, a lot of compounds in spices are oil soluble. A common technique is to cook the spices in oil, which distributes the flavor into the oil and then into the rest of the food. Think about making soup and adding onion at the end, you get bites of onion flavor, versus letting the onion cook from the beginning and the onion flavor distributes throughout. Mainly, you're letting the water soluble flavors distribute throughout the dish."

"I bought a 25lb bag of flour from Costco because it was cheaper per Oz, how do I store it and preserve it?","The following is a paragraph from The Bread Bible by Rose Levy Berenbaum:

>**Freshness**   
I have to confess that for years I never believed flour could get stale, as long as I couldn’t smell any off flavors, but I was dead wrong. I learned the now-unforgettable lesson when developing the recipe for the baguette. No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get those lovely open holes in the crumb. I called everyone I could think of, and somewhere along the line someone suggested that maybe it was the flour. What I was using was three years old. I bought a new batch and the favorable results forever changed the way I think about the shelf life of any dry ingredient. I learned that unless you freeze flour, it is essential to date it the moment you bring it into the house and then ruthlessly throw it out after 3 months if it’s whole wheat or rye, after one year if it’s white flour. No ifs, ands, or buts. As flour ages, it loses its strength. If it isn’t stored airtight, it will absorb air in a humid environment or dry out in a dry environment. Only cake flour, which is chlorine bleached, seems to have a virtually indefinite shelf life, if stored airtight. Flour isn’t expensive enough to risk wasting your time with an expired one. Excess oxidation is the enemy of good bread. In the mixing phase, a certain amount of incorporated air is desirable, but in ground flour, undesirable oxidation starts to takes place from the moment the grain is cracked and exposed to air. This is why the whole unground grain can keep for as long as five years, if cleaned and kept dry and cool, but whole wheat flour keeps for only about 3 months. A common practice in milling is to moisten the grains to make separation of the bran easier. One of the benefits of this practice is that the bran flakes into attractive little pieces instead of powdering and merely darkening the bread. If the moistening and drying is done quickly, there is no down side, but if not, the moisture is likely to activate enzymes that will cause the flour to deteriorate more quickly. If you are in doubt as to whether your whole grains are still viable after prolonged storage, soak some of the grains in water. If most of them don’t start to germinate (sprout) after 2 or 3 days, the grain is no longer alive and should be discarded.

"My aunt gave me some eggs from her chickens. I boiled one, and it's gone kinda weird. It overcooked a bit so the middle it is close to hard boiled, but the edges are like over hard, like completely solid, and then there is a white ring separating the solid edges from the middle. The solid stuff is-","I actually did a poultry judging contest once(don’t laugh, they are real). You have super fresh eggs. Like grade AA.   An egg has the yolk and two levels of “whites”. An inner that’s more firm and an outer that’s more “watery”.  As the egg ages the inner white gets looser and kinda merges with the outer.  

So a grade A, the two whites you can kinda still see the separation when you crack it(a plain white or single color plate will help you see this) but they blend together as they cook. AA, that inner white is super firm and doesn’t mix.  So the outer cooks harder, the inner and the yolk cook “normally”

Also, pics would help me to verify that as im just going off a nearly 20 year old memory."
Difference between Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala?,"Northeast U.S. here.

How come the beef at my favorite Mexican joint tastes different?,"I'm gonna put these here as possibilities that are common in traditional Mexican cuisine:
- cooking with lard
- high fat content beef
- beef/pork mix
- granulated bouillon

Other than that, there are so many varieties of dried and rehydrated chilies used in Mexican food that make a huge difference in flavor, each of them with a distinct flavor from the next. Next time you're there, I'd ask what type of chilies they use, so you can get a little closer to what you're looking for. 

Specifically, what kind of beef filling are we talking about? Is it in a sauce/ cooked with tomato paste?"

But you aren't going to find an ""original recipe"" because the term was used to describe a lot of different fermented savory sauces. Asking for the original Chinese ketchup recipe is like asking for the original Mexican salsa recipe. Salsa just means sauce in Spanish and there's a huge variety of authentic salsas using a variety of ingredients and recipes."
Are fries traditional in real-deal Greek gyros?,"Un-national ingredients do make it into national dishes. After all, before the European visits to the Americas and asia there were no tomatoes, risotto or mozzarella in Italian food, no potatoes in Ireland and no chilies in Thai or Chinese food, just to name some examples.

Gyros, the Greek version of Donner Kebab, originated not much sooner than the early 20th century. The version served rolled in a pita bread didn't become popular until after WWII. The use of French fries in gyros sandwiches can be traced back to around that time too, though it seems it has become increasingly popular throughout the years.

That makes speaking of how traditional fries in gyros sandwiches are kind of difficult: the whole dish is fairly new and the addition of fries to the dish appears to be closer to its emergence than to today. Calling that traditional or nontraditional depends on where you draw the line, there is  overriding argument in favour or against."

How can I make my home cooked Indian food taste as good as restaurant Indian food?,"This is coming from someone who went through the same process as you are describing a while ago. I tried the various recipes and they never tasted like the nice neighborhood Indian Restaurant food. 

Then I came upon a post on Reddit where someone recommended a particular youtube channel to learn how to make that awesome Indian Restaurant Food.

It turns out it's all about the prep and making certain key ingredients in advance.

These are:

* base gravy (mostly onions, plus carrots, peppers, cabbage, garlic, spices, oil, (I forget the whole list)). It takes about 4 hours to make it.
* Ginger-garlic paste
* Mixed powder (kind of like home made garam masala)
* Spiced oil (optional)
* spiced tomato sauce (optional IMO).
* Variety of maybe 8-10 common Indian spices.

You make/buy those in advance and then you start every dish with all the fresh ingredients that go into your chosen Indian dish.

So there will be some fresh onions, maybe some chicken, lamb, paneer or tofu, fresh or canned tomatoes, fresh peppers etc.

You start with the spiced oil, roast your spices in it, add the ginger garlic paste, add fresh onions, add the base gravy, add the fresh and canned veggies and finally add your protein, plus some finishing salt and spices to taste. 

The whole process takes 10-15 minutes or so, but you need to have all of your ingredients ready to go in advance. 

By now I've made this type of food dozens of times, and unless I burn stuff or over spice, it tastes like Indian Restaurant food every time. 

PS: the youtube channel I learned from is Julian Voigt. Start with his earliest videos to learn all the basics."
Why are pretzels in N. America depicted upside down when compared to European pretzels?,"Boy did this turn into a rabbit hole for me.  I'm a huge pretzel fanatic. Growing up in South East Pennsylvania, this was not an anomaly.  PA is crazy about pretzels thanks to our historically high German population.  I've done a bit of digging and, though I won't say it's conclusive, have an idea of why the quintessential American pretzel is often displayed differently.  

This [article](http://travelhungry.co/blog/2014/6/21/breakfast-at-backerei-frank) on German pretzels makes a very short and frank statement: ""[T]he twist in American soft pretzels is the same width as the bottom and sides of the pretzel, the twist on German pretzels is much thinner, giving you a crispy treat after you enjoy the soft body. This explains why when you see German pretzels, they usually appear ""upside-down"" from American pretzels, with the thick body on the top and the twist at the bottom."" [picture to illustrate](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/535c1783e4b0faf2733dd647/t/53b31234e4b01ed85bc17bce/1404244554110/IMG_0248.jpg?format=1500w). 

I'm not a fan of how the author simply glosses over this fact. Simply saying ""the fat side goes  up!"" isn't much of an explanation. But looking at other culinary trends, this certainly seems true.  A cursory Google image search for any croissant illustrates an overwhelming preference to depict the crescent with the nice soft, fat side up and the ""horns"" down. This same trend goes for any search of ""crescent bread.""  

What I find incredibly interesting is the WHEN that accompanies the WHY of this great American pretzel flip. I've scratched through a number of searches for old Pennsylvania Dutch (Deitsch or Deutsche... in case you didn't know... they aren't Dutch) recipes and artwork and found this beauty: [Picture](http://www.homemade-dessert-recipes.com/images/potato-cake-pretzel.gif) and [Recipe](http://www.homemade-dessert-recipes.com/potato-cake-recipe.html).  This recipe is dated 1915, and is called a pretzel cake! Most intriguing is that the accompanying picture features the European style fat-side-up orientation.  To go back even earlier, we can find that the first commercially successful pretzel factory in PA, the [Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery](http://www.juliussturgis.com) (founded 1861!) features the European pretzel in it's logo to this day.  Another tid bit worth mentioning is that Americans seemed crazy about hard pretzels, certainly far more than their European counterparts. I'd have to research more to be 100% sure of this, but there is certainly a well supported trend within American culinary tradition of favoring foods that travel well across long distances and are more shelf stable.  The traditional European *brezeln* was a fresh baked, daily purchase. Like with almost every other culinary element (fresh fish, fresh dairy, fresh bread...) the compact nature of European towns favored the soft, loafy brezeln, and the wide open spaces of American farm land favored the shelf stable hard pretzel.  It also made economic sense: a bakery can only sell fresh goods in its small town, a factory can sell shelf stable pretzels across the country.  A hard pretzel requires uniformity of width throughout the twist so that nothing burns in an extended baking or drying process. **[SEE EDIT]** It's my conclusion that this contributed to the American aesthetic of the uniform pretzel.  So much so that it eclipsed even the traditional soft pretzel, which eventually adapted the uniform width.

So it seems that at some point in the late 1800's or early 1900's, with the pretzel moving toward it's modern American form, the chubby-side-up/horns down aesthetic just stops working. The new American pretzel looks better with its two arches pointed up. Also, if a pretzel is being sold from a cart or hung in a shop window, it's much easier to load them onto sticks or hooks through the larger holes up top; hanging at a playful angle, arches up.  The largest hole of the German style pretzel, is not the small ""ears"" but the center, and would most likely have hung in shop windows thusly.  

This is all conjecture! But it was fun. Thanks for the great topic. Hope someone else weighs in.

*EDIT*: There's been a ton of great discussion in this thread.  The big correction I need to make is thanks to u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt who points out that the difference in width of the pretzel is much more likely a result of the type of dough used; Stiff dough for hard pretzels that, once rolled, carries its weight during the lift and twist motion vs. soft, enriched dough used for soft pretzels that tends to pull and sag.  Additionally, the whole hanging pretzel posit, which I felt so sure of last night, seems to be completely false.  Google ""hanging brezel"" and it looks like they're still hung from their little ears."

You should contact the brand immediately and tell them both cases with as much lot information as possible. Most brands have forms online you fill out. I would do that instead of the grocer. 

In reduced oxygen packaging (vacuum packed) it is 'very' important to follow the handling and thawing directions carefully, signs of puffy packaging means abuse/mispackaging by either processor or consumer and could be C.bot. 

Worms are normal, pick it out before cooking. Freezing seafood takes care of any true parasites. But good to let the brand know so they can keep an eye at the processing facilty.

And as we know, a huge component of the tasting experience is smell.

And foods tend to have more than enough of whatever makes them smell good, so they continue to smell good after being cooked."
"I just watched a Bon Appétit episode, in which Chris recreated a Gumbo. They were surprised that veal was in it.

Coincided a bit with the rise of vegetarian/vegan diets popularity I think. 

Thats why Sohla in the video quips that she hasnt seen veal in years. Most in the US probably havent. I know I havent seen it.

But nowadays with foodie culture having become and still becoming more robust, veal and other meats are starting to creep back I think. 

And as far as its use in gumbo goes, you arent going to see relatively expensive veal in it very often. Most gumbos are homemade gumbos and will just have what you can get. 

And besides that, that particular gumbo Chris recreated wasnt very traditional anyway, not to mention weirdly constructed. Not browning the meat? Mixing land and sea? Adding a roux to basically make the broth not garbage? 

Yeah. Funnily enough some of the stuff Chris got wrong in his recreation is actually closer to how a better gumbo would be made."

What is Crème Fraîche?,"They're very similar and can often be used fairly interchangeably except for higher heat situations where the sour cream will curdle. 

[However, here's how to make Crème Fraîche and it's shockingly easy.](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-creme-fraiche-in-1-easy-step) Just combine a pint of heavy cream and a couple tablespoons of cultured buttermilk and that's it. You just leave it on your counter until the bacterial cultures thicken it to your desired consistency (depending on your kitchen temp/humidity I've found this can be between 8-24 hours). Once the thickness is where you want it, place it in the fridge to stop the process. 

I was in the same situation as you until I learned how to do this. Now, I literally always have Creme Fraiche in my fridge and use it anytime a recipe calls for sour cream. Its so good!

[Also... now that you've bought buttermilk for the creme fraiche, you can use it to make more buttermilk.](https://www.seriouseats.com/diy-cultured-buttermilk-recipe) Basically the same steps as making Crème Fraîche but use milk instead of cream. So as soon as your supply of buttermilk is running low, top it up with milk, let it thicken, and refrigerate. Assuming you're already buying milk, you only have to buy heavy cream to keep an endless supply of Crème Fraîche and Buttermilk on hand!"

5gr oil

The bao will have a slightly tacky surface because of the tapioca flour - which is what I am used to. The tapioca flour also brings down the protein % (which affects gluten forming)  in the AP flour and make it lighter. 

I ate a lot of bao growing up, but since I live abroad I have to make it at home now. And I second the above commenter, they will have to be fully proofed to yield a fluffy bao. Proof it twice, once before rolling and once after rolling in the steamer. You can add some vinegar to the steaming water to make a whiter bao."

Check the temp, and check that the oven has reached the desired temp, well before putting the tray in."

In a restaurant they may be buying whole chickens (or other animals) then butchering those down. And that leaves bits that can be used for the stocks and sauces. They also have time and equipment to do large batches, and reduce those down, and then add more stock, and reduce it down even more.

So, to try to answer the question you asked: cook the tomatoes. Sometimes you want a lighter fresher pop, sometimes you'll want that 4 hour cook of a Sunday sauce. But most of the time you'll want to cook out the tomatoes to get more intense flavours developing from sugars.

Also, sometimes the recipe will say ""a tablespoon of olive oil"" and you see them glug in much more oil than that."

"Robuchon's Mashed Potatoes: I understand the how, but i'm here for the why","1) This seems like an old school french method for cooking potatoes.  I've read a couple of articles that say various things - it keeps the flavor in, it keeps the nutrients in, it keeps the starches in, etc - but no actual science (from those sites).  Interestingly enough, I looked up the nutritional data for [potatoes cooked with the skin on](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2556/0) and [potatoes cooked with the skin off](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2558/0) and (according to them) skin on potatoes had slightly more of everything - carbs, protein, vitamins, etc so there might be something to having more flavor.

2) The butter, as others have said, is done cold to help with the emulsion.  The idea according to Cooks Illustrated, is that cold butter melts slower and it gives you more time to whisk the fat into smaller droplets that will create a better emulsion.  Warm butter melts too fast for you to break the fat up into small droplets.  

3) This one, while it sound silly and finicky (and it is).  [It does actually serve a bit of a purpose](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/11461-how-to-prevent-hot-milk-from-sticking-to-the-pan).  Milk when poured into a pan and heated will create a thin film where ever the milk touches the pan. A little bit of water in the pan first stops this from happening.  Will this have any effect at all on dish?  No.  Will it help you clean up some?  Yup.  Is this probably something he was told to do when he started cooking and just kept doing because that's the way he was taught?  It's hard to say, but probably."
How do restaurants work?,"Restaurants in their current form work that way because of what is called a ""brigade system"". A chef named Escoffier was the first one to think of this idea. Before his time, and really before modern restaurants, chefs would be hired to come to a house and they would attempt to prepare entire meals on their own, often getting in each others way, and causing a general clusterfuck that didn't lend itself towards efficiency. The idea of a brigade is instead of having multiple chefs working on multiple meals, you have multiple chefs each responsable for one portion of the meal.

This gives you the common positions in the kitchen...I won't get too into details, but in general, you have a grill guy that's charged with handling most of the proteins. Theres a sauce guy, he handles all the sauces, soups and hot recipes. There's a salad guy, he handles all the cold prep and salads. There's the guy whose job it is to get all the other chefs to put the stuff together at the right time. This is a horrible generalization, and there is a lot of variation in the system, but I think this gives you an idea.

So your food comes out in 30 minutes simply because of efficient flowthrough, developed from years of experience.

Let's look at flowthrough....as soon as your server walks away from your table, communication starts. If there is to be salad or appetizers, this is communicated first, so that it reaches your table first...but let's focus on the entree...you ordered Grilled Chicken with a Cheese sauce, fried potatoes, and steamed asparagus with Hollandaise sauce.

The first step starts when the ticket is received...usually there is one chef that will look at the ticket and communicate the various needs down the line. The first instruction would be to the grill guy to fire (start cooking) the chicken.

Next would be instructions to set (to make ready to cook) various items, like your vegetables and fried potatoes made to the various chefs responsable for those items.

He would also let the sauce guy to go ahead and get one order of cheese sauce ready. This cheese sauce was made earlier in the day, and only requires heating. The Hollandaise sauce is probably a make to order item, so the sauce guy will begin working on that.

As the chicken gets close to being done, the other items will begin to finish, with the timing being defined by communication and experience. The chef will get the chicken from the meat guy, the veggies from the veggie guy, the fried potatoes from the fry guy, the sauces from the sauce guy, and put the dish together and make it ready for sale.

This process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes depending on how involved the recipes are, and the millions of differences in quality of restaurants; i.e. a cheap bar and grill is probably just opening a can of cheese sauce for your chicken dinner, while a fancier place may be making your cheese sauce to order, and those two things take very different amounts of time.

The secret to the brigade system is simple. First, having your ingredients in place. That's prep...if you use sliced onions in your dishes, you don't slice an onion every time you need one, you slice a bunch ahead of time. Some foods are precooked, but not as many as you'd think...bacon is a big one that's done ahead of time, and almost nowhere will half-cook food, as that affects both safety and quality of most foods. There are some exceptions. Second, communication and teamwork help the system move along, being able to process multiple plates at the same time. The average grill guy that we used in this example could have as many as 50+ items on the grill at one time, depending on how busy it is.

Sorry so wordy, I love the business! And remember those guys next time...your server is the face you get to meet, but if you really enjoyed the food, ask your server if you can buy the guys in the kitchen a beer...not everywhere allows it, but that's a thing, and they'll appreciate it!"

How much of a commitment is sour dough starter?,">Do I really need to feed it daily?

There are many different methods out there, but the first one I followed that worked well for me had you feed every 12 hours for the first 5 days. 

>Can I put it in the fridge to slow things down? If so, for how long?

Yes, once established (when it consistently doubles or more within 4-6 hours after feeding) you can put it in the fridge. You can feed it once every 1-2 weeks without issues. I take it out the day before I want to bake with it and feed it twice before baking.

>Can I use my sour dough starter in most bread recipes, or is it mostly centered around sour dough bread?

You can, but proofing times will be doubled or more for certain things, depending on how much of the starter you use in the dough. When you are first getting started I recommend you follow recipes that use starter until have a good understanding for how long your starter takes to proof various types of dough. During this time, you should learn about what changing the ratios in your starter achieves, and how different temperatures change proofing times. These are very important when working with sourdough. 

With pizza specifically, heat is the main source of leavening, so anything that builds some gas bubbles in the dough will work, then the heat expands the bubbles that are present. Long, cold fermentations work quite well for sourdough pizza. 

Overproofing occurs when the ethanol byproduct of the starter breaks down the gluten network in the dough. A low ratio starter and a high percentage of starter in the dough will hasten proofing times. Conversely, a high ratio starter and a low percentage of starter in the dough will slow proofing times.

Get the sear on that you like, put them on a tray(s), let them come to the same temp, then put all 10 in the oven at the same time. That should enable you to have a consistent done-ness on them.

Striploin would work well."
Why is gnocchi sometimes chewy and sometimes pillowy?,They're meant to be pillowy and soft. Mass produced gnocchi is usually chewy and is considered poor quality. They're just different though imo. I love pan frying packaged gnocchi until crispy. Look up the brussels sprouts gnocchi on nyt cooking it's soo good.

"Cheaper soda waters have larger harsher bubbles, more expensive ones have smaller softer bubbles. What accounts for the difference?","Contrary to a lot of the mythology surrounding Champagne and carbonated water, ""tiny bubbles"" has nothing to do with quality directly, only the amount of CO2. More CO2; bigger bubbles. (Temperature and nucleation sites being equal)

People often associate small bubbles with quality because higher quality vintage Champagne is aged in its bottle where it loses some of its CO2 resulting in fine bubbles. Cheap sparkling wine is not usually aged, so it retains its CO2 and has bigger bubbles.

Naturally carbonated spring water also usually has less CO2 than soda water that is carbonated during bottling, hence the association of quality and bubble size.

Carbonation levels are definitely a matter of taste. I prefer high carbonation levels, but not everyone likes the tingly burn."
Why do some foods (like bolognese ragu) taste better the next day?,"As well as whatever magic happens in the fridge - you become nose-blind to dishes that cook on the stove for hours, which means you don't usually taste it properly on the day you make it.

Cook onions and garlic before adding ground beef for tacos?,"Brown the beef, remove, the onions will kind of deglaze the pan as they sweat, then add garlice, then mix the beef back in.

"European alternatives to America’s Test Kitchen, Serious Eats, Wirecutter","There isn’t a great one imo, either in the EU or UK. Everything I’ve found is either sorta blog-spammy or quite old-school in its methodology (in US terms, think Consumer Reports rather than Wirecutter)

The good news is that quality kitchen tools have *pretty* good global availability. A lot of the best brands are European, so that’s easy to find in Europe, and many of the best American brands get exported widely too. There aren’t a ton of “gold standard” items that aren’t pretty easy to find in Europe, and in those cases, there’s often a European alternative that’s even better (e.g. Demeyere vs All-Clad cookware or Magimix vs Cuisinart food processors)

That said, I think Serious Eats and Wirecutter (in that order) tend to be better about testing stuff that’s available in Europe than ATK"
How do big restaurants and take-away places not 'overcrowd' the pan?,They have wok burners that have like 5 times the output of your home stove.
I'm constantly seeing people recommend rinsing your rice and toasting your rice. How do I do both?,"I rinse my rice good and let it sit for a minute or two in the strainer while I get oil hot in the pot. Then I throw the drained rice in and cook it. It'll steam off that bit of water for a minute but then you'll start smelling toasted flavors after a couple minutes. That's when I add my broth/liquid and cover and cook.

I generally always use basmati or jasmine rice fwiw."
Can (Polish) Pierogi be cooked the same way as Japanese gyoza / Chinese potstickers?,"Polish and perogi lover here: I don't see why it wouldn't work. But depending on the dough it may need tweaked. Maybe try it with just a little piece of dough or just 1 perogi and see if it works to your liking. 

They're pretty durable little pockets of delight if you made them right, more even if they're store bought. I've played around with 3 or 4 different ways to cook them and so far the only one that goes south is baking because they dry out quicker before the inside gets hot. Any wet method (frying included in this case) should work fine."
"I tried making ramen eggs by marinating a soft boiled egg overnight in a mixture of 30% tamari soy sauce and 70% mirin. They came out really bitter, what did I do wrong?","I'm no expert on this but I would assume that much mirin and the fact that mirin has an alcohol content would really mess with the egg proteins. Over exposure to alcohol with any protein (not to mention a simple one such as an egg) is probably bad. That's just me guessing but I think my hunch is right. I would try some water, shoyu, way less mirin OR cooked (to lower the alcohol) mirin"

What exactly is the taste in Chinese sausages?,"Depends. China’s a big country with more culinary diversity than most, so “Chinese sausages” is super vague.

As mentioned already, in lap cheong specifically it’s a sorghum liquor called “Fenjiu” or rose wine and candied pork fat that gives it the signature flavour. Western produced variations are often pretty sad quality compared to what’s available in China, and lots of folks don’t seem to realize it absolutely needs to be cooked before eating as it is not aged long enough to be foodsafe uncooked."
What’s that fancy way to cut whole potatoes called? For French dishes? They kind of look like a jewel?

Why the use of boiling oil on asian sauces?,"Aromatics like star anise and dried chili peppers burn VERY quickly, so you want to take every step to avoid that, but Asian cooking also often uses high heat to get a certain flavor out of the oil.

Is there a way to make Beef Wellington without the finely chopped mushroom that encases the tenderloin?,"I mean the asshole answer is no, you can't make beef Wellington without mushroom. But you can certainly make beef something super dope wrapped in pastry!! 

A fine mince of spinach and walnuts has served me Wellington enough (sorry)! 

I make the paste with frozen spinach, thawed and DRIED out. I throw it in a food processor with walnuts, garlic and a bit of worcestershire to get that real unami flavor but a good cut of beef will give you what you need! Spinach has a similar earth flavor and walnuts a similar mouth feel. I find the best success with raw walnuts, not roasted."
Is there a significant drop in nutrients or fiber if you blend vegetables?,"Short answer: no.

If anything, blending may have a marginal positive impact on nutrient absorption by increasing surface area (no chunks of undigested corn and such in poops)."
How do restaurants cut vegetables?,"This depends greatly on the restaurant. Big chains often times order in the ingredients pre-cut by machines.

For a more upscale restaurant, they have prep cooks that work in the AM. Their sole job is to do all the prep before the chefs do their work at night.

So I recommend the day before, do as much chopping as you can, or grab a friend to help if they have skills or can follow instructions well. Chop all veggies and prep any ingredients ahead that you can.  Like sauces...often times a sauce you can make in a big batch a day ahead (and can actually taste better too!). Pasta can be cooked al dente and be stored (coat pasta in a small amount of sauce to keep from sticking).

And write down EVERYTHING. List each dish & side. Then list for each dish what needs to be prepped.

From there, group like items. So if you need carrots for 2 different dishes, cut all the carrots at one time. You can then either store the cut carrots together (assuming you need the same shape and size cut for both dishes) or for ease of final cooking day, go ahead and portion it out. So when you go to mix in the salad ingredients, you are just grabbing bags or bowls of pre-measured ingredients.

This preserves your thinking power for the big day."
How do salt and alcohol get rid of gamey flavors?,"I don't know but I'm just commenting to let you know you just blew my mind! I didn't know about the male pig thing. It's been a real problem for me that pork sometimes smells disgusting to me and I just can't eat it, but other times it's fine. Hope you find your answer! If you know why the smell/taste occurs, perhaps you can look into if salt breaks it down."

How to Create an Aftertaste and Layers in General,"First of all, let's define ""aftertaste"". This is just the taste that lingers on your tongue after all of the aromatic compounds have been sensed and all of the other taste compounds have been washed away/swallowed. We also have to make the distinction between aroma and taste. Aroma is what  you sense with your nose, and taste is what you sense with your tongue. Aroma is what makes a strawberry taste like a strawberry and not a raspberry, while taste is saltiness, acidity, sweetness, bitterness and umami. Aroma without taste is equivalent to smelling something, while taste without aroma is what you get when you have a cold and ""cannot taste anything"". Flavor is not specifically defined, but I generally use it as the overall sensation you get combining aroma and taste.

As for what gives an aftertaste. That is generally up to what taste compounds you have left on your tongue. More often than not the aftertaste is the prevailing overall taste compound of the food that becomes more apparent after the main flavor profile as the aroma isn't there to distract you anymore. Another way an aftertaste can present itself is if there is a fat soluble compound that isn't rinsed away as easily by your saliva, as most acidic, sweet, and salty compounds are. Especially bitter ones can be in the latter category, which is why this is more often considered an aftertaste (also because we generally think bitterness tastes bad).

So what can you do about this? Well, either you can dilute it (keeping in mind if it is water soluble or fat soluble), or you can balance it with other flavor compounds so it doesn't stand out but instead works together to form a more cohesive flavor. Diluting is easy, balancing is hard and requires some experience (but practice makes perfect).

For bitterness in general, all other tastes balances it out to some degree, but umami and acidity are particularly good for this (in my opinion).

&#x200B;

EDIT: To add on some more comments: Prolonged cooking can also alter a lot of these compounds. Some are more stable than other. For example, you can boil salt water for ages and nothing would happen with the saltiness (except for evaporation of the water), while more complex taste compounds will break down and possibly change the perception your tongue has to it. How much they can break down and how big of an impact it can have, I cannot entirely say, I'd have to leave that to an organic chemist to answer."
What stock do chefs use?,"Premade stocks and concentrates are fine for a certain level of restaurant. Most nice restaurants will make their own. We brought in 200lbs of veal knuckles for veal stock, and 200 lbs of chicken backs for chicken stock every week. Veal stock for sauces and bolognese, chicken stock for soups and many other things. Fish stock/fumet from in house fish scraps as needed."
Grew a lot of cayenne peppers in the garden this year. Is there a best way to make cayenne powder with them WITHOUT a food dehydrator?,"I have seen them threaded on a string and the hung up to air dry, but I have never tried this method. I have done them in a very low oven with the door cracked open a bit. They come good but are a little roasty and darker than store bought cayenne with a pleasant nutty finish."
What should I test?,"Pickles. I want Pickles that make you go damn...but there is a million ways to go achieve pickles. I want the crunch, the tang and the deliciousness. "
Who do I always get a large tendon in my homemade drumsticks but not in prepared cooked chicken?,"You have to cook chicken leg so the collagen in the tendon breaks down into gelatin. People worry about over cooking chicken but that tendon will only start to break down at 160* F and it needs to stay at that temp, but not to far above (which will dry it out in a long cook) for it to continue breaking down. With fried or grilled chicken because of the temperature the collagen will breakdown quickly but with oven roasting or rotisserie the breakdown of the collagen into gelatin takes longer. So I would guess you might not be cooking your legs for long enough to dissolve that tendon, even though you may be pulling them once they reach 165* F."
Stir-frying contradicts a lot I've learned about cooking so far,"Firstly, stir-frying at home is distinctly different from wok-style cooking with those large burners. The former is a home method of one-pot recipies. The latter is almost only available to special kitchens.

I wouldn't say Chinese wok cooking (or any stir fry) tries to get oil ""smoking."" The wok is heated dry - without oil, and then oil is added at the last second right before cooking. This both allows for a quick non-stick surface, and prevents oil from smoking. However, in general, home stir fry style cooks food in small pieces, so there isn't as much time to let it sit and brown, so you'd like as high temp for a little time. You want the oil hot - shimmering so wooden chopsticks tips start to bubble when dipped in is a good metric - but not smoking. These temps are far below the temp of non-stick coating breakdown.

During cooking, oil is ""stir fried"" quickly with a lot of mixing to get air incorporation. Ideally, it also gets a bit burnt from the live fire, giving it a singed flavor much like dripping fat onto charcoal gives that distinctive cookout flavor.

Lastly, aromatics are not universal. Sometimes you add them in the beginning if you want to build flavor; sometimes you add them at the end as garnish. Same with starting by sauteeing onions or adding parsley at the end as garnish. Generally, tougher more root-like aromatics serve as better to cook in the oil in the beginning, like ginger or garlic, whereas 'greener' aromatics like basil or green onions should go in at the end. Exceptions exist - maybe you want a pungent garlic flavor with minced stuff at the end. Again, there is no absolute rule for cooking from an entire culture , just as there isn't an absolute rule for Western cuisines. 

For you example of Kenji vs Ramsay, I'm assuming this is fried rice recipies? Take a note on the size of the meats they're adding. I would wager Kenji is adding ground beef, while Ramsay may be adding bigger cuts. The principles of cooking in general still apply.

Just keep cooking to get a sense. Some chefs like Gordon Ramsay have to consider what British cooks have in their kitchen, and thus may deviate from 'authentic' if it just means more people will branch out, which is never wrong. I recommend following recipies to the letter the first time to try to get a sense of the goal, then adapting it the second time based on your experience/experiments."
Is it just me or is cooking chicken to 165F result in overcooked chicken?,"Destroying pathogens is a question of time *and* temperature, not just one.

"Why does a lot of Chinese restaurant pork taste so ""porky""?",Also probably the use of lard
How can restaurants use excessive amounts of salt and not have their food taste overly salty?,"Excessive is subjective. 

When people talk about restaurants using a lot of salt they are doing it by way of comparison to home cooks that traditionally under-season their food.

It's not such a large amount that it would ruin anything, it's just more than many people use at home.

It's also a matter of knowing how and where and when to use salt appropriately as opposed to just dumping it all in at once at the beginning or end."
"Ramen recipes say that you need to cool the broth immediately if you arent using it right then. How do i cool down a hot pot of soup without diluting it, leaving it out, or putting it in the fridge?","Ice bath in the kitchen sink is an easy way with no extra gear (immersion chiller, etc)."
Ruined a large batch of fried shallots.....what did I do wrong?,"Malaysian restaurant line cook here!

Start with warm but not hot oil. Add your shallots and bring them to a rolling boil. Keep the heat relatively high until the shallots cross that threshold where they're dehydrated enough that they no longer boil and begin to get shiny on top. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir frequently. The closer they get to being finished the more stirring they will require. During the final 2 minutes or so they need to be stirred constantly. Picking the exact right moment to remove them can be tricky and takes practice. Keep in mind that they will continue to darken for a minute after they're out of the oil. Pull them when they're 1.5-2 shades lighter than the final product. They won't become crispy until they have cooled to room temperature.

Always have your paper towel lined sheet tray and spider ready well in advance. When they're done they're done and you have to be ready. The difference between perfect and burnt is about 10 seconds. Fluff with chopsticks immediately after they come out.  Fried shallots turn out best when made in decently large batches. I recommend at least 4 cups sliced shallots and at least 6 cups oil. Do not salt them."
Is uncured Pancetta just straight up pork belly?,"The FDA regulates that a cured meat product can only be labeled ""cured"" if the manufacturer adds nitrites to it.  ""Uncured"" meat like the Boars Head Pancetta, generally has celery juice/salt in it which naturally contains nitrates.  Nitrates break down into nitrites so it's funcutally the same thing, but it's one of those quirks and unintended effects of a government regulation that has now become a marketing gimmick to trick people like my mom into thinking it's healthier because it ""doesn't contain nitrates""."
Why is it not standard to add salt when first making homemade pasta rather than when we boil it?,"My understanding is that it effects the gluten in the pasta.  Salt actually strengthens the gluten which could result in a tougher, chewier texture. This isn't to say that you can't add a bit of salt, just that too much could have adverse effects on your pasta. By seasoning the water you are not causing problems in the dough itself."
I love food - but I don't want to become a chef,"There's a huge, huge world of food that you don't even think about in your grocery store.

"The cooking order of onions, garlic and vegetables. Can someone please clear this up? Im confused?!","It depends what you're making. There is no single 'best method' if that's what you're after. You need to consider what result you're hoping to achieve and the best method to get there. Flavour is not a single attribute that you have more or less of, it is a whole range of different attributes, and by treating the same ingredients in different ways you can create a range of different flavours.

A mirepoix doesn't contain garlic, and you cook all three vegetables slowly together, without browning, because you're not looking for a caramelised flavour, you are looking for the first layer of layered flavours. There is (obviously) nothing wrong with caramelising, but it's not the right thing for every recipe. 

What you describe sounds more like a stir-fry, and if that's the case, and you want all elements to have the same degree of doneness, then you need to add them in reverse order of cooking time so that they all finish at the same time. If your garlic is chopped much smaller than the other ingredients then it will take less time and should be added last.

I suggest looking at good (non-blogger) recipes for whatever you're trying to make, and see what they suggest."
"Does ""medium-high heat"" mean the upper section of the medium range, or the middle section of the high range?","Unfortunately there's no straight answer

It depends on your stove and your pans, so you'll need to develop a feel for what's low and what's high heat on your given equipment 

But to try and describe it, I'd say that medium is the temperature on which you can sauté onions and medium high is what you'll use to brown meats on"
"Why braising pork belly results in fall-apart goodness, but sous-videing does not?","Acid in the wine might make a small difference in the outermost layer of meat, but the biggest difference here is temperature. Collagen breakdown isn't a binary yes/no above 160°F, it accelerates with higher temperature. (And even occurs below 160, there's just a big spike in the rate around there.)

You could go hotter if you want more tender, but in theory just cooking longer at 170 should give a better result. Maybe try 16 hours next time."
How do restaurants handle excessively starchy water?,"Restaurants use pasta cookers which have a drain and a fresh supply of water.  The excess starch foams up and runs down a drain.  Similar to an overflow drain in a bathtub. You can adjust the water flow for how mush pasta you have, how much you want to drain. It’s a simple but effective tool for cooking noodles in large quantities.  At home, just use a big ass pot or cook in batches"
My recipe tells me to reduce oven heat from 450 to 350. Does this mean I open the oven door to allow the heat to reach 350 faster? Or am I meant to keep the door closed and allow the heat to reduce slowly?,The latter.  The recipe assumes your oven will change temperature gradually.
"Made a seafood chowder with over $100 worth of ingredients, but after adding canned clams the whole thing tastes horrible, is it just a loss?","Yeah canned shellfish is always worth checking every single can.  I’ve gotten several bad cans of crab in my career.

Also, a cheddar pear pie. I've also had good experience sticking them into grilled cheeses. They also do really well when you just toss them in a pan with bacon, cheese, and bread squares so you get some sort of deconstructed bacon grilled cheese."
Mineral oil is not a thing in my country. Alternatives for oiling cutting board?,"The name 'mineral oil' by itself is imprecise, having been used for many specific oils over the past few centuries. Other names, similarly imprecise, include 'white oil', 'paraffin oil', 'liquid paraffin' (a highly refined medical grade), paraffinum liquidum (Latin), and 'liquid petroleum'.Most often, mineral oil is a liquid by-product of refining crude oil to make gasoline and other petroleum products. This type of mineral oil is a transparent, colorless oil, composed mainly of alkanes and cycloalkanes, related to petroleum jelly. It has a density of around 0.8–0.87 g/cm3 (0.029–0.031 lb/cu in).

Due to their susceptibility to oxidation from the exposure to oxygen, heat and light, resulting in the formation of oxidation products, such as peroxides and hydroperoxides, plant oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have a limited shelf-life.

Presumably a wooden cutting board?  My favorite mahogany has never been oiled per se, regularly washed particularly after cutting meat (oily) and occasionally bleached with chlorite.  Woods are rich in phenol which is a fine anti-bacterial."

I need help looking for a specific Vietnamese dish.,"Another Viet person chiming in! Here is the ELI5 break down for those that want to re-create the dish with recipe links, as well as my slight divergences from current prevailing opinion in the thread:

* Bún = translation is just ""noodles."" In this context, it's thin vermicelli rice noodles. Easy to source if you're by an Asian grocery store, cook according to package directions.
* Grated carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, romaine lettuce = probably fresh veggies as described, sliced thinly or julienned. But do note that đồ chua (""sour stuff"" in Viet, pickled vegetables in English parlance) is commonly used and typically comprised of carrots/daikon. It's often included in Viet deli/restaurant dishes. \[[Recipe link](https://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2009/05/daikon-and-carrot-pickle-recipe-do-chua.html)\]
* Nước chấm = translation ""dipping sauce"", comprised of nước mắm (fish sauce) and other ingredients to tilt the flavor profile from pungent to a balanced sweet & savory \[[Recipe link](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/easy-nuoc-cham)\]
* Thịt nướng = ""roasted meat"", but generally refers to lemongrass pork these days \[[Recipe link](https://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2009/04/vietnamese-restaurantstyle-grilled-lemongrass-pork-thit-heo-nuong-xa.html)\]
* **COUNTERPOINT:** OP talks about BBQ'd, red-dyed pork, which to me sounds more like thịt xá xíu (""thịt"" = meat, ""xá xíu"" = Viet rendering of Chinese ""char siu"" bc of overlap from nearly 1,000 years of colonization) than thịt nướng. Is it strictly/traditionally Vietnamese? Purists would say no. But really, Vietnamese food & cooking has been indelibly shaped by its links to French & Chinese occupation, and its culinary tradition is further complicated by the diaspora. All this to say: honor ""roots""/""tradition"" when you can, but recognize these things are always in transition/negotiation/adaptation based on real lived experience by the Viet community settling in a variety of different places. ""Authenticity"" is both a myth and static constraint, IMHO. But that is a soapbox lecture for another day, and most people are just here for the food talk which is fine \[[Recipe link](https://www.vickypham.com/blog/vietnamese-barbecue-pork-thit-xa-xiu)\]

"When tempering chocolate, why do we raise the temperature above the temper temperature before cooling it down and bringing back up?","Cocoa butter is made up of 3 fat molecules that each have a different melt point. When CB cools, you need those molecules to form beta crystals. You achieve that with movement and agitation. Manufacturers want the chocolate heated to a point that all of the CB is melted as you can't form beta crystals with only 2 melted molecules so they recommend a high starting temp. The higher temp you heat to, the longer it takes you to cool it down so I melt it to just above 100F (38C) and stir it until it falls to 92F (33C) and then use it. The thing about beta crystals is they're like the cool kids in high school. Once other molecules see how to line up and form betas, they follow suit and make more beta crystals and over crystallize your chocolate which is why it gets so thick event though it's the same temp as earlier. Hope all that makes sense."

"My cheese sauce always is grainy, even when adding cheese with the heat off. What am I doing wrong?","I assume you're adding your milk/stock/water too fast? 

You need to add your liquid in batches to your roux.  Each time allow the mixture to completely emulsify together and allow it to ""boil"" - bubbling in between stirs.  The flour must fully hydrate/cook or you'll end up with a grainy sauce.


Once you have a consistency you're happy with (remember it will thicken more as it cools) take the sauce off the heat and continue stirring to cool the mixture.  Just because the heat is off doesn't mean the hot mixture won't split added cheese."
Why do we cook rice on low heat and covered while we cook a similar volume of pasta on high heat uncovered? Aren't they both absorbing the water over roughly the same amount of time?,"Like others have said, you can definitely cook rice like pasta.  My wife is Persian, she cooks rice like pasta until the side of the pot is hot to the touch, drains it and then steams it on top of flat bread with butter for crispy tagdikh.   Which might be the tastiest thing in the world.  

Persian rice is the best rice.

Is MSG as bad as people say?,"MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, which is naturally found in cheeses, tomatoes, fish sauce, etc. Glutamic acid is the molecule that gives us the sensation of ""savoriness"" or umami. As one might expect, this flavor (and thus molecule) is found in most cuisines, though the origin may differ.

There is not any high quality evidence that MSG has any adverse effect on humans*, see [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8282275), for example.  The idea that MSG can cause negative effects likely originated with a letter (not peer-reviewed research) to a journal about ""Chinese restaurant syndrome."" The idea likely stayed alive by a combination of the placebo effect and mild fears about cuisines seen as ""foreign"" (at least in the US).

Culinarily, MSG can be a bit unsubtle. MSG by itself is a pure savoriness, so it can be easier to overdo than adding too much cheese or soy sauce to a dish. However, when used well, it can really amp up the flavor of the dish.

Edit: People are correctly pointing out that glutamic acid is a non-essential amino acid (and most common neurotransmitter), meaning not only does it naturally occur in your body, you can produce it by yourself.

*Additionally, there's at least one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766026?dopt=Abstract) suggesting that MSG might increase IBS in fibromyalgia patients who have IBS, but it's a pretty small study."

Cantonese/Southern Chinese Cookbooks,"- The Key to Chinese Cooking - Irene Kuo

While the book purports to be a general Chinese cookbook, the author and recipes are almost all Cantonese. In the cases where a recipe is from a different region of China, the recipe is the Cantonese interpretation as opposed to truly authentic. For instance, the Sichuanese recipes are the Cantonese interpretations of them, as opposed to the real deal. If you're familiar with Sichuanese MaPo Tofu, you'll find the Cantonese version in this book to be much milder. A few illustrations but no photographs. It's a fairly large book, and contains instructional sections on techniques, ingredients, and equipment in addition to recipes.

- Chinese Village Cookbook: A Practical Guide to Cantonese Country Cooking - Rhoda Yee

A very short book that covers the core home style cantonese dishes and techniques. The book is quite old (seventies), so it doesn't have the shortcuts you might find in a modern text. Some black and white images, but few of them are of finished dishes.

- New Cantonese Cooking - Eileen YinFei Lo

Written for the American audience, but the recipes are true to Cantonese cooking. Contains a good mix of home style, restaurant, and elaborate banquet dishes. No images or illustrations, but dish names are provided in english, romanized cantonese, and hanyu so you can google image search for them.

- Jia! The Food of Swatow and he Teochew Diaspora - Diana Danxia Zheng

While this book is not technically Cantonese, I feel compelled to promote this title as I very much like it, and Teochew cuisine is fairly intermixed with Cantonese food. They originate in a similar geography and several Teochew dishes have become mainstays of Cantonese cooking, so you'll recognize many dishes if you're familiar with Cantonese food. Has images for almost all recipes and detailed background on the cuisine and recipes."
"Butter is expensive in my country, is it possible to make puff pastry with margarine instead?","Someone with more experience might correct me, but I believe the reason butter works in puff pastry is that its water content turns to steam in the oven, creating separation in the dough layers. Margarine is pure fat so might not work. Further, butter can be beaten into thin blocks (which are folded into the pastry dough). Margarine is usually spreadable and not mouldable, so it might be tricky to achieve the 'puff' texture.

That said, I've read that you can make shortcrust type pastry with oil only. I haven't tried it but there are [recipes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/easy-oil-pie-crust-recipe-304979) out there with good reviews. Maybe these could be an acceptable substitute? Homemade phyllo is another option though it is a ton of work.

> Also, if you have any ideas for what I can use to substitute the following I would appreciate it;
Cream cheese, cream of tartar, lard, buttermilk.

Cream cheese: depends on what you're making, but if you strain yoghurt overnight it gets thick and creamy. Doesn't have the same fat content as cream cheese so this might not work in baking.

Buttermilk: yoghurt beaten with enough water to make it a thick pourable liquid. Or, for some baking applications, milk mixed with a spoon of lemon juice/vinegar and let stand for fifteen minutes.

Lard: you can render this out of meat, there are tutorials online. Might actually use this to make pastry afterwards."

Is there any way to tell how good a watermelon quarter is before buying?,"The area of the watermelon that rests on the ground during summer goes from white, to cream color then to dark yellow. You want the dark yellow indicating that it's the sweetest you can get. So if you see the yellow rind, even when they're quartered, then get that one. Also you could go by the darker, juicier and softer flesh which should be sweeter. I'm not recommending poking your fingers into the flesh to check but one can tell how the flesh is just by looking at it"

Fancy whipped cream?,"They probably said Chantilly, which is sweetened whipped cream often flavored with vanilla"
Does rubbing spices on a potato before throwing it on a pan add flavor or just burn them?,"I've experimented this with a lot and I disagree with the top comment here. Toasting spices takes a few seconds - you lose so much of the flavor as you keep cooking them after that. I used to season the crap out of my potatoes early on but realized they always ended up tasting so monotone. The heat flattens everything out in my opinion. 


Now, I sautee the potatoes on high heat with lots of oil or butter and get them super crisp first. Then i remove them, add some olive oil and the spices, let them bloom for a bit, and then toss the potatoes back in and toss in the flavored oil. The flavors are pronounced, fresh, and at their best this way. Kenji does something very similar with his roast potato recipe.


I do find that if you're cooking on low to medium heat or if your goal is to meld flavors together like a stew or curry then the long cook time is fine. But even in these cases I tend to add a few fresh spices here and there towards the end of the cook to layer flavors. 


Garlic is one of the spices that most commonly suffers from long cooks destroying the flavor. You know how some people claim that they have to triple or guadruple the garlic cuz they love garlic sooooooo much? Yeah, no lol. Try adding a few cloves fresh right at the end and you'll see what a dish tastes like when the original garlic flavor is preserved."

How do restaurants make raw tomatoes taste so good?,"have you ever tried a good sliced up heirloom tomato from the farmer's market (aka local grown and picked when actually ripe, not artificially ripened) with some salt and freshly ground black pepper? probably a similar experience."
Are you supposed to eat the rind of Brie cheese?,"Like everyone is saying, yes, but if it's crappy brie or too cold it won't be enjoyable. Super cheapo brie rinds can have a sort of ammonia taste, and if it's right out of the fridge the mouthfeel won't be pleasant.

But a nice wedge that's been sitting out and is getting all Salvador Dali on you??? Eat that shit"
How do you get the smell of onion off a wooden cutting board?,"Baking soda slurry, followed up by rubbing lemon rind on it goes a long way.  Also, using end grain board helps here, the capillary action allows liquids to penetrate, and the then “leave” more efficiently.

But, I simply keep a small board handy that I use exclusively for onions, garlic, and their relatives.  It keeps everything else from picking up the flavor when you’re prepping.  Apples are notorious for this if you chop after an onion."
Why do a lot of chefs sprinkle salt instead of grinding it?,"Pinching makes it easy to get a lot of salt quickly, and also to have a very easy idea of how much salt you’re using. Grinding is slower and harder to measure. Plus, grinding provides no culinary benefit (it’s not like freshly grinding spices, there aren’t volatile aromatics in the salt that are retained better in larger crystals)."
Why does the type of oil dramatically affect the texture of my brownies?,"Though both are oils, they are made up of different components.  Sunflower oil is composed of (basically) a 50/50 ratio of oleic acid (omega-9; a monounsaturated fat) and linoleic acid (omega-6; polyunsaturated fat).  Safflower oil is (basically) 80% omega-9, 11% omega-6, 6% palmitic acid (a saturated fat) and .02 % linolenic acid (an unsaturated fat) with the rest being trace nutrients, vitamins, etc.  Knowing that the two oils have very different amounts of saturated vs unsaturated fats in them, I think it's fair to say that your ratio is off because of that.  I can't read the ATK recipe so I don't know what their thoughts are but /u/bc2zb is a biochemist and may have a better ideal of what's going on here."
"When frying, why do you start at the right temperature, add food, then wait for the oil to get back up to temp. Why not start higher, add food and let it go to the right temperature?","A lot of the coatings we use for frying things are susceptible to burning at higher temps.

And if you're frying something like chicken it takes some time to cook all the way through to a safe temp.

So if the oil is too hot your crust will burn before your meat is fully cooked. So it's better to just let everything take a little longer  and finish at the same time.

You can start a bit hotter than suggested and it'll be fine but if you go too hot it can cause problems."
What’s the best way to ruin prime rib?,"My initial comment: cut their portions from the properly prepared medium rare roast and microwave them because they deserve it.

My actual comment: cut portions from the properly prepared medium rare roast and finish to temp in an oven."
Is there a difference between store brand and brand name spices?,"If you can't tell the difference, then there's your answer.  There are definite differences with some spice suppliers but you pay a premium, Penzeys is the best example I can think of.  I generally don't find a huge difference between cheap store brands and McCormick's for example."
"In a mirepoix, instead of using celery, can I use leek instead?","Leeks are an onion, but they have a pretty mild taste and are a welcome addition to most recipes."
"Weird Situation: I run the high schools cooking club but don’t have access to the kitchen until an hour after we leave school, what can I do?","Culinary background. It's a fantastic lead in. Give an explanation for the cuisine you're prepping, why the ingredients are used, where it comes from. Cultural appreciation is a huge part of understanding the food you're making. What's the history of the dish? Try some fun facts about the ingredients, common pitfalls to avoid, hints or suggestions for troubleshooting common issues, flavor profiles (i.e. what goes well with what). You'll not only not need the kitchen for this, but it also allows people to ask questions beforehand."

Is making chicken stock from scratch cost effective?,"If cost effectiveness is your goal, then save up your scraps in the freezer and use those to make your stock.

"If MSG was less villainized in American culture, would we see its use increased in recipes over ingredients added simply to add umami (soy sauce, fish sauce, etc.)?","Then again Restaurant Depot sells giant bags of it, it's in every bag of chips and in most fast food, which are unfortunately staples in the US - more than 1/3 of Americans eat fast food any given day (McDonald's, TB, etc.) It's more prevalent than people think.

Help! I was frying oil in a ceramic pan and had shut the pan off. I came back and saw it dripping and realized the pan was broken and the stove was filled with oil. How do I know when or if it’s safe to use?,"This is going to be tough. You’re going to have to find a way to open up every place that the oil spilled into and clean it out to the best of your ability. 

Once its as clean as you can get it, you’re going to have to turn it on and burn the rest off. Open all the windows and run the vent fan if you have one. Maybe light one burner at a time and let them heat up. Things will likely smoke a bunch, but that’s okay as long as there’s no fire. 

If you get all the burners burned clean, you’ll have to do the oven too. Turn it on high and see what happens. Hopefully not much got into there and it just burns off anything left on top. 

This is all going to smoke a bunch unless you miraculously get all the oil cleaned up beforehand. You’re really going to want as much airflow as possible and to keep a good fire extinguisher nearby just in case."

How do you get a good sear on marinated bulgogi?,"As a korean who grew up in Korea, bulgogi is just not supposed to be seared. It’s typically just cooked on the pan more like “jo-rim” (starting wet and thickening with heat) because the marinade makes it too wet and thin shaved surface makes it impossible to dry it properly and that’s perfectly fine. That’s the way it’s eaten in Korea. I think what you might be looking for is LA Kalbi style meat + marinade. This thinly sliced ribs are really easy to seat properly and has very similar flavor profile as bulgogi (sweet soy sauce flavor)."

"Why does adding blue food coloring make whipped cream/meringues ""whiter""?","It has to do with color theory. Typically, if you want to neutralize one color, you would use the opposing color as seen on a color wheel. Whipped cream/meringues are on the yellow (or warmer) area of the color wheel, so using blue food coloring (even purple works) neutralizes the yellow. This results in a whiter or brighter whipped cream/meringues."
Simple foods for my Autistic Brother in Law to try?,"does he cook? Instead of offering food out of the blue, maybe teach and guide him into making the food can create a spark of interest from the tasks, the history of food, the chemistry in it.

So I would try to cook with the things he already likes and build up different flavors from there. He likes rice, he likes pasta, have he tried rice pasta? Could you throw some vegetables in the pasta water and see how they change the flavor in the pasta? Can you taste with him different kinds of paprika, compare them and add them to rice? Talk about how paprika is made, where is it from, how they use in different countries. 

He likes rice and he likes cheese, what about risotto? What is a simple pasta sauce? a simple butter sauce bothers him? can you build up different fat flavors to cook different fat sauces, like bacon fat, high fat sausages, etc? From there, you can add black pepper, talk about spices, silk road, etc.

Doesn't he like sweet food? Rice and coconut milk is delicious.

The hint you gave me was cheese. Unless we are talking about ricotta or mozzarella or something like them, cheese is one of the most complex flavors humanity has created. Perhaps he does like stronger flavor, but he still has not found the right incentive for him to go after other flavors.

Also, does he know how to make ricotta? it's so nice and you can make it at home! And it's so easy to make different things from it and to add different flavors from simple spices and veggies."
"Why is ""pork stock"" uncommon in comparison to chicken and beef stock?","A big part of it has to do with butchery methods. If you ever watch European seam butchery which is done with your hands and a knife, you will see the emphasis is on maximizing usable meat.

In the US you see a emphasis on efficiency of cutting up as many animals as fast as possible. Band-saws galore! 

In charcuterie you want to take the maximized muscle option so you can get the Coppa. The neck muscle that Americans cut off in the middle when they create the Boston butt. 

In the US band-saw world you end up with ribs that still have meat on them. Actually a whole different way to ask the question is ""Why are there no good rib bbq recipes coming out of Europe?"".  

So in europe they remove the bones that have hardly any meat on them, and toss them into the stock pot. In the US you get bones with your pork butt, chops, and ribs....

"Unable to open bottle of maple syrup no matter what I try, help!",Heat the cap under hot tap water.
Learn to taste,"1. You have to start by differentiation between taste and aroma. Taste is only salt, acid, umami, bitter and sweet. Aroma is thousands upon thousands of different nuances. It is what makes a strawberry ""taste"" like strawberry instead of an indistinguishable blob of sweetness and acidity. Taste is the backbone of flavor, and then you build upon it with aromas to make a complete flavor profile. Taste without aroma is what you get when you have a cold and ""can't taste"" anything. Aroma without flavor is what you get when you make something and it tastes ""bland"". Identifying what of these two problems you have is the absolute number 1 skill to learn if you want to be able to ""taste"".  
So in your question you ask ""When do I add salt, and when pepper"". Here is a main problem. Salt brings a lot in taste, but nothing in aroma, while pepper is heavily aromatic, but basically nothing in taste (apart from the spicy element).  
My advice is to try and distinguish the taste profile of food you enjoy and think about how to balance salt, acid, sweetness, umami and bitterness. A hint is that acid and sweetness balances each other, and salt and umami balances each other. Bitterness often lightens up a dish when low, and can be balanced by all of the others. After you have an idea on how to balance taste, you can start with adding aromas to this.
2. Try to break down the sauce. First the taste and then the aroma. What can you sense, how is it built? The reason it is tasty is probably mainly the balance of taste, and the aromatics just make it extra interesting. But if you can make a sauce with the same balance it will still be good to you, even if the aromatics aren't on point.
3. To become better you mainly have to think about the flavor of the things you eat. Why is it good? What is good about it? What drives the flavor profile of this dish?"
Can you eat any type of fish sashimi style or ‘raw’?,I was taught in USAF Survival School that the only fish likely to be safe eaten raw are salt water fish from outside the reef.
Is chicken stock improved by smashing the bones first?,"I'm sure Kenji did this in the food lab and the answer is yes... But it can lead to a grittier /murky stock as all the marrow and bone particles end up in the stock.

It improves the timing for making the stock (takes less time) but needs properly strained, which can be a pain if you don't have a dishwasher to clean the stuff afterwards! (me!)"
Does anyone have any tips on cooking without salt?,"I’ve read that something like 70% of the average person’s salt intake is from processed food and restaurants, so I’d take a good look at what pantry items might have needlessly high sodium levels and try to make some substitutions there. Stuff like jarred sauces, seasoning mixes, etc would be pretty easy to sub with much lower sodium."
"How would you ""elevate"" a pretzel salad?","I had never heard of this and uncharacteristically covered my mouth in shock while reading it.

For anyone else like me who didn't know what it was: it's a pie and the crust is made of pretzels, I guess the salad is just a serving method?"
"Cornstarch disobeyed orders and went AWOL. So, how do I thicken a mushroom soup with flour when it is cooking in a crockpot?",You could make a roux. Equal parts flour and melted butter
"frozen spinach says ""must be fully cooked"". Does that mean I can't use it for smoothies?","This warning is due to many bacteria that won't die with freezing, such as E. Coli, Salmonella, Listeria and some others. Spinach and irrigation can easily be contaminated with bird's poops.

And before anyone say, no, blanching (which is usually done as part of the flash freezing process) isn't always enough."
Is crust actually more nutritious than the rest of bread?,"The outer crust of bread contains pronyl-lysine, an antioxidant which is generally considered good. But all milliard reactions, including the browning of bread, create a carcinogen (acrylamide in this case) so it kind of cancels out. 

Short version: eat the bread you like, do something else with the bread you don't."
"Can I make a batch of cream brûlèe mixture, store in one container in the freezer and then sperate it into ramekins, bake it after defrosting?","Yep, its freezes fine. Just make sure to fully defrost it and give it a good shake to re-mix it as it may separate a bit. Used to freeze it at work all the time because I was making hundreds of them a week so I batch made a ton of mix."
Non-umbellifer substitutions for cumin and coriander in Indian cuisine.,"Replacing coriander seed and cumin means you are looking for earthy, smoky, astringent, and sour notes. 

Epazote, especially fresh, has a streak of anise and is astringent like coriander. 

Mexican Oregano has an earthy tone as does paprika which is sometimes used as a sub for cumin.

Annatto/Achiote is also earthy like cumin. 

For sour, tamarind."

"My girlfriend said its my ""turn to cook"" (i can't cook), what should i do with these 2 duck breast fillets i have?","Duck is not for beginners, if you want it to turn out great. Duck is considered a technical protein to cook with and goes downhill very easily.  I would suggest getting another protein."
Why do chefs hate pressed garlic?,"Garlic has a bunch of different flavor profiles depending on how much damage you do to the cells and how it's cooked.

In order of increasing potency:

* Whole
* Roughly chopped
* Lightly smashed
* Chopped
* Finely chopped
* Grated (microplane)
* Pounded into a paste.

Once you have the size pieces you want, the flavor profile changes greatly depending on how much it's cooked.

It's sharp when raw, and gets milder as it's cooked more, so roasted whole cloves are very mild and sweet, while pounded into a paste and eaten raw will knock your socks off.

If a chef wants the garlic chopped, it's only because that's the kind of flavor s/he is looking for, and not because there's anything wrong with any of the other methods.

Any ill-will towards an actual garlic press is probably just because they aren't very good. I've been through a bunch of them ranging from cheap to expensive and in the end every single one broke or became uncleanable (looking at you - die cast aluminum). 

I'm not actually certain that a knife is faster or more efficient to *use* than a press, but if you factor in cleaning time and that it's just going to break, a knife is a lot better overall. If you need more than a knife will get you, you're probably looking at a mortar and pestle."
Why do some recipes call for butter and oil?,"Two reasons - flavor and technique

Flavor.  Butter isn't just a fat, it's a dairy product.  The milk by product in butter gets a nutty flavor when you brown it.

Technique - One thing I've done is seared meat with the cooking oil but finished it in browned butter."
MSG contradictory?,"Yup, tomatoes are a source of glutamate.

Also, any nutrition course that bashes MSG is a little scientifically suspect...."
"How do I make a well/well done ribeye steak, good?","There are two main beef proteins affected by cooking, myosin and actin.  Myosin denatures at 104-122F and actin denatures at 150-163F.  When actin denatures, it contracts and becomes very firm, squeezing out moisture and fat.  The actin is most responsible for the toughness of well done meat.

Beef is well done at an internal temperature of 155F, but the myoglobin responsible for the red color denatures and turns color at 140F.  At 140F beef loses 6% of it's moisture, and at 160F it loses 18%.

Given all that info above, the trick to a tender well-done steak is to raise the internal temperature above 140, denaturing the myoglobin, without reaching the 150F that causes the actin to denature.  140F will still be red, but 145 will lose the redness.  A steak pulled at 145 will continue to transfer heat to the core, raising internal temp by another 5F, to 150F.

In other words, you need a good thermometer and you need to pull the meat off the heat at exactly 145F internal temperature and then let it rest.  The additional resting time also allows more collagen to denature, becoming gelatin, which adds to the moisture and counters toughness."
"I'm trying to recreate a salad I had in France, and I've hit the wall on finding the right radish. (More in text.)",French Breakfast Radish is oblong pink & white. It’s a pretty mild radish and very popular. I will assume that the farmers market will have them.
Should stainless steel frying pans stay shiny and clean?,"The term 'stainless' is a misnomer. It should really be called 'rustless' because that is what the product us designed to do - not oxidize. Just keep your pan clean, staining can happen."
"How can I make ""pizza sausage"" from plain ground pork?",Fennel seed and crushed red pepper would be easiest. Maybe with some garlic and onion.
Why can't you eat shellfish that didn't open during cooking?,"Generally because it's assumed the critter was already dead when it went into the pot, and might have been dead for some time. When a creature dies, microorganisms move in, and while cooking to temperature will kill the microorganisms, often times their waste products are toxic and heat won't do anything about that. It is those toxins that make you sick.

That and once you have ever had food poisoning you will make sure you never, ever get it again."

"What the heck is a ""Farmer's Hat""? Has anyone heard of this food?","This is a thing in my extended family, but it’s really regional and it’s fry bread.  Farmers hat (per my late grandmother) was both a reference to size and to opacity, because a “straw hat” is Fritos or noodles or some kind of shredded something (varies to match topping).  Both were usually made in a 10” cast iron skillet.

ETA: I am not under any illusions that I am the authority here - just this is what I know it to be."
A good history of plating trends?,"The best way to learn about professional plating is to research food history and trends by region and era. For instance, formal dining in the 19th century is referred to as [service à la russe](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mairtin_Mac_Con_Iomaire/publication/254584494/figure/fig40/AS:650032365723685@1531991201709/Table-Setting-for-Service-a-la-Russe-Source-Glanville-and-Young-200250-51.png) when plating trends moved from having all courses brought to a sideboard at the same time and instead were served sequentially. Also when elaborate table settings came into vogue and why people now eat with cutlery from the outside in. Still piling crap onto a plate, but with charger plates. As Michelin rose to prominence, French food became even more codified post Larousse and at the time was very sauce forward and more about shining a light on the protein. A great deep dive in to Michelin food universe which describes a lot of the plating concepts is [The Perfectionist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000P46S0C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) about Bernard Loiseau. Spoiler alert, its not a great ending for a very talented dude. Fast forward to the 1960's, nouvelle cuisine came to prominence in the South of France with small portions, ingredients forward with delicate plating based on Japanese kaiseki plating techniques championed by the Troisgros brothers, Roger Vergé and Paul Bocuse. Vergé and Bocuse trained my [French Master chef food mentor.](https://www.instagram.com/chef_herve_malivert/) I am still making nouvelle inspired dishes like [this](https://imgur.com/05Xtkop) and [this](https://imgur.com/iFxtzUN) because simple and elegant is my personal plating style which has taken years to develop. The 80's saw a trend towards architectural plating with max height [like the China Grill Salad](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/562d4cebe4b0be3275ffb310/1445874441935-1AC9ND5UQJZR8TC5HPN6/image-asset.jpeg?content-type=image%2Fjpeg) I probably ate once a week for ten years working in Black Rock, just like shoulder pads and Texas 'the bigger the hair, the closer to god' was the aftermath of the Reagan years.  Along came molecular gastronomy and Ferran Adrià [and El Bulli](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/12-iconic-dishes-el-bulli-ferran-adria.html), and recently [deconstructed dishes](http://theartofplating.com/news/eat-dessert-off-the-table/) from Grant Achatz. Then its just an never ending sea of an overabundance of swooshes and microgreens.

"Russian bread with a ""Fruity Pebbles"" taste?","It's commonly known in the flavor world as ""BLOV"", or butter, lemon, orange, vanilla. To drive it towards fruity pebbles/fruit loops, skip the orange and focus on lemon. Throw a bunch of zest in there and it will gravitate towards the profile you are looking for. Bonus if you can get your hands on pure lemon oil, as it skips the bitterness that a bunch of zest may impart. 

Accent with a little lemongrass to give it a curveball. Lemongrass is high in citral, a volatile compound with a characteristic fruity Pebble citrus flavor."

How to make French toast more “eggy”?,"Higher heat, shorter time. You want eggy interior, you want to not cook the interior to where it solidifies. Think eggs over easy.

"Poured boiling water over a raw duck, stank up kitchen, normal?","The human nose is exceptional at picking up thiols, if it smelt bad like 'rotten egg' bad then I wouldn't eat it. But if it just smelt like gamey meat then it should be fine. A few years ago I got a bad duck for Christmas, I took it out and had one sniff of the skin and knew straight away it was rotten. If the smell turns your stomach and makes you feel sickly thiols are definitely present and I suggest you discard it."
How to make Thai curry thicker and more coconutty?,"Several things you could  do

1. With any coconut milk (fresh/can/box), before doing anything with curry paste, cook coconut milk on high heat so it releases its natural fat. In Thai, we call it 'breaking coconut fat', Bring about 1/4 cup of coconut milk to boil on high heat until the milk starts to look glossy. That's the fat.  Add curry paste to 'fry'. Then proceed to add the rest of coconut milk 
2. If you want to go the extra mile, you could make your own coconut milk. Buy fresh (old) coconut, shred the flesh, put it in cheesecloth, squeeze it (no water added). That's the richest milk you'll get without reducing it to cream.  We call this the 'head' of the coconut milk. You use this part at the beginning of cooking ie rendering the fat per my instruction above. Now you would have shredded coconut that has been previously squeezed. Don't throw it out. Add about 1/2 cup of warm water, wrap it in cheesecloth again. This is the 'tail' of the milk, add this part as a broth for the curry. 
3. Sometimes you could find frozen shredded coconut from an Asian grocery store. It's not like fresh coconut but it's better canned or boxed.

I also agree with other posts. The quality of milk matters."
How do restaurant vinaigrettes remain tightly emulsified?,"Couple of thoughts based on my experience.

Blending technique matters. You generally have all your water based ingredients together, and then slowly add the oil in. If you just throw everything together and blend, you're not going to spread the oil out enough, and it'll re-coalesce and separate.

But your restaurant probably does use binders. Ours was xanthan gum. couple of grams and it'll hold a dressing together pretty strongly, but you get heavy handed the result gets kind of slimy and gross, so use with care.

You already mentioned mustard, but garlic and cheese were two others that we used to hold dressings together. 

last little tidbit i can share is make sure everything is as cold as reasonably possible when mixing. I don't know the mechanics, but a warm vinaigrette breaks way faster than a cold one."

Hard boiled egg peeling method. My worst nightmare.,"Yes, this has been brought up time and time again. The foolproof way to peel eggs without the shell sticking is to **BOIL THE WATER FIRST, BEFORE YOU PUT THE EGGS IN.** Boiling the water WITH the eggs in it will cause the egg proteins to bond to the shell.

I want to challenge myself as a cook. Is there a cookbook with difficult or interesting recipes that would develop and widen my culinary skillset?,"If you want a challenge, try tackling all the various doughs for Chinese buns and dumpling wrappers.

When I first looked into it, I was shocked at how much variation there is. The main variation is the temperature of the water and the percentage of hydration, which was surprising to me. A hot water dough is not going to behave the same as a warm water dough or a cold water dough, and blending half hot and half cold or any combination of the three in various proportions and at various hydration levels gives different outcomes. The heat does something to the proteins and the starches which I don't understand, and these effects can be exploited to fine-tune the effects you want to see in your dough, whether leavened for a bao style bun, or unleavened for dumpling wrappers, scallion flatbreads, and other Chinese pastries.

You can get dumpling wrappers that are springy, chewy, soft, flakey, brittle, stretchy, not stretchy, and all sorts of variations on texture by manipulating the temperature of the water you use to hydrate the flour. Then you can start using flour with different levels of gluten, and start messing with the alkalinity of the water, for another year of experimentation and learning.

Here's the two variables of hydration and temperature, and the applications of each that I was able to observe from the videos (not complete):

|Water variables|*Low hydration*|*Mid Hydration*|*High hydration*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Hot (> 70˚C)*|Chinese 'tortillas',  tender shumai wrappers|Crispy skin potsticker wrappers,|Crispy spring roll skins,|
|*Warm (70˚>T >30˚)*|Flakey scallion flatbreads|Flakey and somewhat chewy thin layered dough thing. Hand pulled noodles (I think).|Flakey chive-stuffed pan-fried dough pockets|
|*Cold (< 30˚C)*|Firm noodles|chewy dumpling wrappers|Somewhat elastic spring roll skins|

This channel has some of the videos that introduced me to this concept. See this playlist:

There's also a curious method of using a ""tang dzong"" (hot water roux), to modulate the texture of non-hot water doughs:

I instinctually cut the heat when adding cream to finish a sauce.

Ways to instill depth of flavour with plant based ingredients?,"There are great vegan traditions in both Chinese and Indian cooking. Take a stroll through those and see what you find.

grossly simplified, classic Indian cooking relies on a masterful use of spices to enhance the flavors of simple foods while Chinese cuisine is more focused on umani producing foods like fermented beans or mushrooms. Same thing goes on to a lesser extent in European cooking with tomato based sauces providing the umani hit.

if you have some lentils around see if you can find a dal recipe to try. You may have to substitute or eliminate some spices, not going to ruin anything. they often sauté some onions and garlic at the end and mix it in in a step called tempering which introduces another jolt of flavor.

Try to find a simple Chinese stir fry that uses  mushrooms in a secondary role. They also are masterful at tofu recipes. Sometimes you need access to special sauces but you don’t need it all the time. You’ll want to have ginger and garlic around and of course, soy sauce. 

there’s a whole big world of delicious culinary traditions formulated by people who rarely had access to meat. Go out and explore it!"

"Is there a resource you’d recommend to improve my plating from home cook to better-than-home-cook? Also, how many random plates do you own?","Apologies as this is a bit of a re-post as I have written about plating around here a number of times before. 

Plating tends to be trendy and publishers don't really like to address topics that aren't going to keep selling, so there are few written resources.  And the market for info on plating is 99% chefs and we all learn on the job. 

But I have accumulated a lot of plating fundamentals over the years from working for a succession of French Master chefs that I am happy to share. 

The main concepts are: Colour, contrast, construction, and composition.

* No brown on brown or white on white. Use elements that are [different colours](https://imgur.com/05Xtkop) but don't use more than three or four or the plate will get busy. Use colours that are [complimentary.](https://imgur.com/jm7PsbA) You kind of have to pick your shots, mushroom sauce is never gonna be the prettiest kid at the prom. There are ways to work monochrome but its not a personal favourite of mine.

* Each component should be [distinguishable from its companions.](https://imgur.com/iFxtzUN) A pureé, a sauce and a pile of beans might taste great but aren't going to be pretty when splashed together. Lord knows I love me a plate of cheese enchiladas with refried beans and rice, but even as a chef I'd be hard pressed to make that plate look like anything other than delicious slop.

* Mashed potatoes are freaking delicious but dumped on a plate, aren't going to look good. Use a piping bag or [a ring mold](https://imgur.com/KGtnSp3) to provide form and construction to un-formed elements. Likewise, potatoes au gratin are the bomb, but a scoop of them is gonna look garbage. A portioned [block of dauphinoise](https://imgur.com/rlSP58E) or a fondant is going to be more elegant. Uniformity of shape and size is [pleasing to the eye](https://imgur.com/DkJYThq). And don't sleep on the [humble hasselback](https://imgur.com/ZR20TCE) for an easy but pretty potato.

* Work from the ground up. Pureé on the bottom, protein on top, veg under/to the side, garnish strategically. [Elements should touch,](https://imgur.com/cR0juZ1) not be placed separately about the plate. Consider what side of the dish is going to be placed in front of the person eating. No one wants the back end of a piece of chicken, you want that [golden skin to be right up in their face.](https://imgur.com/3T3VCAa)

* If you want to get a fancy, invest in [squeeze bottles to place dots of sauce,](https://imgur.com/5lPszRJ) learn how to [strategically drizzle things,](https://imgur.com/oYR51RA) how to use a spoon to make [the perfect rocher. ](https://imgur.com/mZqKUwo) They're getting a wee bit cliché these days, but a few microgreens can go a long way to dress things up, [mix of textures, elements and colours are your building blocks](https://imgur.com/ESSjy0R)- add in nasturtiums, wafer thin mandolined radish and cucumber, citrus supremes and fluid gels and now you've dressed up boring old crab salad.

* When it comes to the actual plates, most restaurants don't have a huge variety of them simply due to cost. Worked for a chef who would shout every time someone broke a plate:  ""Now I gotta sell 20 fucking cheeseburgers to pay for that fuck up.""  What you see on fancy social media are often one offs or sponsored. But when it comes to selecting shape/style, often its about contrasting [the round against the linear](https://imgur.com/Nyb0vz2) or centralising a dish [within negative space.](https://imgur.com/RbtNIdo) In a restaurant setting its more about designing the dish to go with the plates you already have in inventory rather than the other way around.

Why do so many things float when they're cooked?,"For most starch based things, cooked (gelatinized) starch can only hold onto 2 water molecules whereas uncooked starch can hold onto four water molecules. So, starch gets hydrated with four molecules of water, then when it gets gelatinized, two of those molecules get released. Because gelatinized starch creates a nearly watertight network, the extra water gets converted to steam, but is trapped so things float. For meats, a similar thing happens, but it's the tightening of the meat protein matrix that squeezes excess water out, and some gets trapped inside and converts to steam."
Where do culinary schools such as Le Cordon Bleu get their cooking equipments?,"Chef here who used to work in a culinary school. 

For a lot of items they cut deals directly with the manufacturers. They guarantee XYZ numbers to be purchased over XYZ amount of time in exchange for lower costs and often times a joint marketing arrangement. Especially for things like knife kits, small appliances and cookware but even down to bulk purchasing of heavily used items like butter and chocolate. The uniformity also helps to maintain an even playing fields across classrooms and create a consistent 'product' aka turning out uniformly trained students. 

Le Cordon Bleu even has an online store where they shill products 'as used by the chefs/students of the school' so you can see exactly who they have done deals with. They also do product licensing where they allow companies to use their logo and branding on products.

Go on the websites for culinary schools and they will usually have a [partnerships section](https://www.ice.edu/newyork/partner-with-ice) that lists the brands they use."

How does cooking oil with salt on a stainless steel pan make it non stick? And why are there conflicting views about it?,"Are you talking about seasoning your pan with a layer of polymerized oil? That can be done on stainless steel, but the layer won't be as long-lasting as a similar technique on cast iron or carbon steel.

Or are you talking about cooking with oil? That's what people generally do with stainless steel, and relies more on the oil being hot enough to denature proteins on the surface of the food before they can bond with the metal of the pan and stick. Stainless steel isn't nonstick like teflon, but with good technique - using enough oil, using the right heat, deglazing, allowing stuck food to finish cooking and release - it shouldn't be an issue.

I have not heard of using an oil and salt mixture to make a nonstick surface. Can you point to a source?"

How do I bake an egg on a pizza?,"When it comes to home pizzas and eggs, my go to is to take the pizza out when it is close to done (1-2 minutes left), have the egg pre-cracked in a bowl to make sure you keep the yolk intact and pour it into the center. Then make sure your broiler is on if you have been using the standard bake at high heat. Keep an eye on the egg and take it out as soon as the whites set. You should be able to tell when the white sets by giving the pizza a little jiggle. The yolk should still move while the whites are almost completely firm (keep in mind it will cook a bit once you take it out, so if the whites are completely firm in the oven, you likely wont have a super runny yolk)."

"Historically, was hummus always smooth?","I don't know about the med / actually middle east but the hummus we had when I was growing up (in the Maghreb) was more like a purée ... not 'lumpy' as such but also nowhere near as fine-grained or creamy as your standard supermarket hummus you get in the West.

"Grandmas toffee recipe keeps separating, need a large quantity for her memorial service- how do I fix this??","You can try adding glucose syrup/light corn syrup(or replacing some of the sugar with it). Also, I would probably recommend not stirring because stirring causes sugar to crystalize. Make sure that you are not using metal utensils to stir. You can also warm up the almonds in the oven before adding them to the toffee to prevent a large temperature difference.  If everything else fails you can add lecithin."

Pizza party for 15- what do I dough?,"I’ve done pizza party’s like this for as many as 30 people. (It’s the most fun party since we have a wood fired oven!) I would recommend making the dough the night before (or longer for more flavor development, up to you) and just doing one type. I think it would be fine to do it just in one bulk ferment, and I would divide it into balls (by weight) and place on a baking tray in the refrigerator to store before people arrive. 

Definitely prep all of the toppings and divide up the sauce(s) into a couple of bowls in advance. 

A couple of things to consider: 

1. How many “stations” are you going to set up? Two people can share toppings/sauce, but more than that can get chaotic.  

2. Do you have more than one rolling pin? Even though it’s not the “right” way to do it, most people don’t have the skill to toss them, and having rolling pins makes it simpler. 

3. Is there another person who’s really good at making pizzas? If you are maning the oven, someone else at least mostly knowledge should be helping guide the people preping them. (Making sure there’s enough semolina so they don’t stick etc)

Gosh, now I want to make pizza!"
"Looked everywhere for a bakery job, please help.","Unfortunately, this is probably the worst time in history to be looking for a job in hospitality. Thousands of restaurants have either closed permanently or are at lower capacity. No one is traveling so hotels are also at low capacity.  Few to none at all crowds at entertainment and sporting venues. So all of these places where there would normally be food service are no longer employing people in food service. There is a huge glut of experienced food workers vs. demand for them. The first ones hired back will be ones that were furloughed and who have experience and connections. Even the wages being offered right now for open positions are significantly lower than normal. Not sure what to tell you- there isn't a single chef position being offered within a 100 miles of where I live in England where we have had a slightly better government reaction to the pandemic.

Food jobs are largely word of mouth. Try old employers and colleagues. Look on craigslist and Facebook. Good luck."
Mashed potatoes- what's your method to get the right consistency?,"Whatever your method one of my Chefs pointed out to me the value of draining as well as possible. Less water makes room for more butter. Another version from a past chef was throwing some parsnips shallots and garlic in with the boil and some processed horseradish in the whip. Nice allium, sweet from the parsnip, a little heat / acid. Whatever you do I also enjoy post mash putting it into a casserole dish, try to create a flat surface. Throw a little melted butter and parm on top, cracked pepper a little parsley. Throw it under the broiler and just create a nice crust. Sorry this isn’t about consistency just some thoughts"
How much of a difference does cooking a pan sauce for 20-30 min make?,My guess is if the sauce involved flour you need to cook the flour flavor out. If you don't cook it your sauce can taste like raw flour and it's not a great taste always.
Wedding Cake + Corona virus = novice sibling baker anxiety,"- Don't use purely fondant for the roses; gumpaste is ideal for decorations. Mixing tylose powder with fondant will give you a quick alternative to gumpaste. This is also less likely to crack (compared to fondant) and will keep its shape.

- Make your decorations ahead of time and keep it in an airtight container. Sugarwork can generally keep for a while but, again, keep it in an airtight container and away from humidity.

The main tip is save yourself time and stress by making the cake ahead of time. Cake freezes well, so if you're inclined, make the cake ahead of time. Buttercream also freezes well (bring back to room temp before using). This will remove a lot of stress so you have time to focus on decor.

Hope this helps you out! Stay healthy!

Edit: Last minute tips

- If you're unsure about cake recipes (some recipes out there just aren't good), practice by making cupcakes instead of full cake rounds.
- Cut recipes by half for practice until you've nailed down your bakes and techniques  (same applies to the frosting you'll use).
- CHILL AFTER CRUMB COATING. 10-15min in the freezer usually does the trick.
- Pipe your frosting layer on instead of slathering it on with an offset spatula. You'll get more of an even layer of frosting this way.
- For a smooth looking cake, heat your cake scraper with hot water before smoothing the sides.
- Sketch your cake so you have an idea of what direction you'll go with!"

Why does store bought stock always taste better?,[deleted]
Weekly discussion: Authenticity in food,"Of course in a basic sense if the food you make is tasty then nothing else matters. This includes authenticity and anything else. So, that's my initial response.

But I do think there are reasons to care about authenticity. In a lot of contexts, people have not been exposed to a wide variety of tastes. They've grown up eating the food of one culture and even when they've had food from other cultures it's actually just another kind of food from their culture, albeit with influences from another culture. ""Chinese"" food in America and India is a good example. American ""Chinese"" food and Indian ""Chinese"" food is not much like most food from China (aka ""authentic"" Chinese food). That's not to say it's bad - it's merely different - but it's definitely not as new or innovative to someone who has grown up in America or India as a lot of actual Chinese food would be.

So, one reason to insist on authenticity, and on cooking Chinese food like they cook in China, is because this will expose you to new flavors, ingredients, techniques, and combinations. I think it's always good to expand your palate. Insisting on authenticity isn't the *only* way to do this - you could after all just buy a bunch of stuff you've never eaten and try making your own stuff - but it is a *huge* shortcut, since (for instance) China has already figured out tasty things to do with ya cai or doubanjiang or fermented tofu and you can cook those recipes to learn what these things taste like and what you can do with them.

Another reason to worry about authenticity is bigotry. Speaking now just about America (which is where I'm from) a lot of people from non-American cultures face a lot of bigotry with respect to their authentic food. (The podcast Racist Sandwich has a lot of great discussion of this.) A child of immigrant parents who brings authentic Indian or Chinese food to school will often get taunted by the other children, ostracized, etc. Lots of Americans will refuse to eat at authentic ""ethnic"" restaurants because they're afraid the food will be too ""spicy"" or ""weird"" and a lot of that just stems from straight up xenophobia. This means people from these cultures are forced to ""water down"" their food to appeal to the dominant culture or face prejudice, and that's not fair at all. Insisting on the importance of authenticity helps combat this because it lends value to doing things the way people are inclined to do it, rather than forcing them to fit in to the restrictive tastes of many Americans.

A related reason to worry about authenticity is cultural imperialism and cultural appropriation. A lot of ""Indian"" food in America is British Indian food, so much so that Americans who don't know anything about Indian food will sometimes get upset if they go to an Indian restaurant and they can't just get chicken tikka masala and butter chicken or things like this. So for instance a South Indian restaurant serving dal, sambhar, idlis, dosas, etc. would make some Americans upset and get pushback for not serving ""real"" Indian food like naan and curry. They'll get their menu explained to them by Americans who think they know what Indian food is, but who don't.

In fact this gets *really* bad for Indian food in particular for some reason, because a lot of Americans are convinced there are basically two kinds of food in India: tikka masala and curry, and they'll insist that all Indian food must fit into one category or another. This means people will label almost all Indian food ""curry"" (a more or less meaningless word) and refuse to accept any Indian food that doesn't match whatever weird definition of curry they have in their head, and everyone has a different one because the word is meaningless anyways. (It also leads to people using ""curry"" in various ways to insult Indian people, since ""curry"" is the one word they think of when they think of India. See [here](https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-the-politics-of-curry-97457). And it also leads to people putting curry powder in all their Indian food, which is ridiculous, because almost no Indian food is made with curry powder.)

My favorite example is [this recipe](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/10/chicken-curry/) from a well-meaning American. She made an Indian-inspired chicken recipe and called it tikka masala because she had vaguely heard of the various Indian chefs suggesting that calling everything ""curry"" is insensitive. When commenters pointed out it had sweet fuck all to do with tikka masala, she gave up and changed the name to curry, the only other Indian-ish word for food she has ever heard. If one focuses on learning about authentic food, one will not be the sort of person who gets angry at an Indian restaurant for not serving British food, or the sort of person who thinks all Indian food is either tikka masala or curry, and so on.

Finally, in the American context, the taste of the broad American public is kind of... not amenable to a lot of people's tastes. Lots of America likes everything sweet and not very spiced or spicy. So when other culture's foods become American they gain a lot of sweetness and lose a lot of spices and heat. Ditto for losing out on fermented stuff (fermented tofu is a no-go for Americans) and other funky stuff. So, insisting on authenticity lets you avoid Americanized recipes which drop some of the coolest tasting stuff. Obviously if you're not in America this is maybe not a relevant consideration.

Now, of course, there's not really such a thing as ""authentic"" since food changes all the time. But I think there's a pretty obvious difference between kung pao chicken in an American Chinese buffet and kung pao (or, gong bao) chicken in Sichuan. And so obviously when people talk about ""authentic"" food they're picking up on *something*."

Brined turkey turned out way too salty. Trying to learn what I did wrong so I don't repeat it next year.,"Don’t trust a brine recipe that uses volumetric measures for salt, you need to use weight here unless it is also specifying the exact brand of salt. 

If the recipe was written for diamond kosher salt and you used fine table salt, you added almost 10x the amount of salt the recipe intended. This problem is avoided if you use weight instead.

Edit: re 10x I just borrowed the chart here and make no claim to it’s accuracy https://www.abeautifulplate.com/cooking-salts/.  The meta point is that salts vary hugely in their density; I once got stuck with Morton instead of diamond and it totally screwed up my calibration while I had it."
Boiling water for pasta starting from hot water instead of cold water?,"The main concern here should be whether your pipes are old enough to have used lead solder. Hot water leaches more lead out of lead solder than cold water. In the US, if your home was built after about 1970, it used lead-free solder. If earlier, you shouldn't drink or cook with hot water, and you should let your cold water run for 10 seconds or so to let water that has set in your homes pipes flow out."

A bit later I am able to again perceive it the same way as everyone else.

Can you make mayo with chilli oil??,"Yes it will make a mayo. Basically any liquid oil will make a mayo at least structurally even if the flavors are a bit wonky, and it is great to play with infused oils to give you different flavors. On the other hand it will likely be way too hot to be pleasant (at least for my tastes and the chili oils I tend to use).  If you already have mayo you can just stir in chili oil to taste or if making from scratch balance the chili oil with a more neutral oil to get the right spice level."

Why are some jalapeños so much hotter than others? Can you tell by looking how hot they are?,"Jalapenos are crazymaking for their variability, even from one plant or within one bag; there is a respectable amount of [research](https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=15571) even.  The only sure way to tell the heat is to cut a tiny bit off the tip and taste it.  As a general rule, I find that the great big ones have been fed and watered so much in growing that they are less likely to have full heat, so I select smaller ones when I can, but that increases your odds without making any guarantee.  I keep a little cayenne based chili vinegar and chili oil on hand to increase the heat while cooking without making a big shift in flavor when the japs are disappointing.  Also, if if the dish I am cooking will have diced japs as a table condiment, I will reserve the milder ones for that use and cook with the hotter ones.  Sliced serranos provide the spicier table condiment and are easily distinguished."

What's this brown gelatinous part under my duck fat?,"That's jellified gold! All the good stuff in a little gelled stock, add it to sauces etc or spread it on hot buttered toast."
Butter in vanilla cupcakes vs. oil in chocolate cupcakes?,"Notice that oil is liquid at room temperature, while butter is semi-solid. Oil provides more of a moist mouthfeel than butter in baked goods. However, oil is also flavourless (assuming a neutral oil of course), while butter has that rich flavour that is so important in cooking.

Vanilla cakes have a very subtle flavour, hence the flavour from butter is very important. On the other hand, chocolate overpowers the flavour of butter, so it's possible to substitute it out for oil for its moistness without noticing much loss of flavour. 

Outside of just the ingredients themselves, there's also the mixing methods. A butter-based cake is usually mixed by the creaming method, where the butter and sugar(s) are creamed together. This isn't simply to just combine the two ingredients, but also to create small air cells within the butter that will allow for additional leavening during baking. This process is known as ""mechanical leavening"", since you're creating leavening from mechanical mixing. Here's an [article](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/12/cookie-science-creaming-butter-sugar.html) from Stella Parks that goes further in-depth on how it works. 

If oil is used instead of butter, then you won't get the leavening from the creaming process, so you end up with a denser product. This is probably why the oil-based batters you've had feel more like a muffin."
"What other fats besides lard or butter are suitable for making crumbles/pie crusts, and why so?","Also, use equal parts vodka and water in the crust ( usually 1/4 cup of each, ice cold.  If more is needed, add 1 tablespoon of cold vodka until it is pliable)

Vodka evaporates more quickly than water, creating a flakier crust."
Why do nonpariel capers come in such narrow jars?,"I put a small strainer over a 1C glass measuring cup, and pour the whole narrow mess into that.

Best books that are a great substitute for culinary school,"Not a chef, but here’s my opinion:

----

Essential:

For understanding food: On Food and Cooking

For sauces: Sauces, by James Peterson

Technique: New Complete Techniques, by Jacques Pepin

Baking: Advanced Bread and Pastry, Michel Suas

All-purpose: The Professional Chef is a fine choice, but there are other options.

----

Bonus:

Knife skills: An Edge in the Kitchen

Wine: Windows on the World

Cooking without recipes: Ratio, by Michael Ruhlman

Seasoning to taste: Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat

Flavor pairings: The Flavor Bible

It also helps to have a few books you can go to for recipes, aside from your all-purpose textbook. MAOFC, Marcella, and Prudhomme’s Louisiana Kitchen are examples of what I mean. 

----

Once you have these books, read and cook A LOT. Doing it at home will take a long time, but the information is there if you’re willing to do the work. Get a job in a kitchen at some point, though, because professional kitchens are a different world from home, and no amount of culinary knowledge alone can prepare you for that environment.

How should you acknowledge servers at fancy restaurants?,"DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT  


Just kidding. A pause and acknowledgment is sufficient when food is being brought to the table - I would think a new course merits that attention! 

The refilling of a wine/water glass happens far more often, a smile/nod/""thanks!"" or some combination of the 3 is fine. You don't need to stop while they pour.  


You can also choose not to acknowledge them at all - but the above is the bare minimum for polite and proper dining."

"I tried making Gordon Ramsay's Salted Caramel Popcorn, but it sticks to each other. Can someone help? (Link in description)","I used to make caramel corn at a restaurant. I would start with brown sugar and butter. Heat to 245F, take it off the heat then stir in baking soda. I would always make the popcorn after the caramel so it’s still hot. Pour the caramel in a big bowl then the popcorn and fold it with the biggest spatula we had. Basically the same as Ramsey. 

Where we differ, I lay it on a baking sheet and bake it at 270F for 10 or so minutes. This brings it to the soft crack stage. Now here’s my trick that made my popcorn the best in the restaurant. Let it cool JUST until you can handle it without getting burned, I would recommend gloves for this, you really want it hot for this part. Use a cold metal bowl, doesn’t need to be ice cold, just colder than room temp, and dump it all into the bowl. The bigger the bowl the better. Gently toss the corn while breaking the prices apart. As the caramel cools from the bowl it harden and keep it from sticking together. If you do it right you’ll start to hear the dinging sound of something hard hitting the metal. If you don’t hear that then you didn’t bake it long enough. 

You can store it in any old container with a lid. Should stay fresh for a few days. I’ve never had it last that long so not totally sure. 

Starting with sugar and butter should keep those crystals from forming. You can also use a little lemon juice, just a squirt. It’s acts as an interferon and keeps crystals from forming. You can also get really fancy and use a brush with some water and wipe down the edges of the pot by the caramel as you’re making it. This keeps crystals from falling into it and forming larger ones. 

TBH not sure why he didn’t say what temperature you should cook the caramel to. I had this conversation with the pastry chef at that restaurant. Some people were just winging it and it wasn’t coming out well because it needs to be pretty exact for the results we wanted. You can get candy thermometers pretty cheap. They also double as deep frying thermometers. If you’re into caramel and candy making - which rules by the way - it’s a tool you’re going to want. 

Good luck!"
"You can't leave cooked rice out at room temperature (b cereus growth) but you can soak raw rice for 12 hours or more, why is that?","I'm seeing all sorts of speculation in this thread and lots of it is wrong. I hope you all see this because I'm a microbiologist and have worked in food testing labs.

The reason you don't want to leave cooked rice out is because of spores. Rice is grown in the ground, gets contaminated, cooking kills the vegetative cells but some would have formed spores already (the form under stress like cooking). These are very hard to kill. When the temp lowers the spores germinate producing a toxin that makes you sick."

How rare can I eat salmon safely?,"[This article](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/05/how-to-prepare-raw-fish-at-home-sushi-sashimi-food-safety.html) covers everything about raw fish pretty well including the temperatures you need to freeze it in order for it to be safely eaten raw per the FDA, the risks associated with eating it below the recommended temp, as well as what the term ""sushi grade"" means (spoiler: whatever the person selling the fish wants it to mean since there's no regulating body that determines what it means)."

That makes it a lot easier to plan out your execution or make changes on the fly, which makes it lower stress.

Also the book The Food Lab by J Kenji Lopez-Alt does the same; Kenji is the culinary editor of serious eats"
"What is the ""korean spicy sauce"" that my local sushi place puts on their tuna sashimi?","Looks and sounds like chojang to me.  It’s a mix of gochujang and vinegar mostly, with some other stuff.  You can easily find recipes off google.

Edit:  what other people are upvoting something called gochujang sauce is actually chojang.  I only want to make the distinction because if you look up recipes for gochujang sauce, you’ll get recipes with incorrect ingredients.  Not that it might not taste good but it just won’t be the traditional taste if that matters to you."
"I just got eggs from a farmers market next to my shopping center, should I refrigerate?","If he was not refrigerating the eggs, that is a good signal that the cuticle has not been washed off.  However, there is no actual harm in keeping an egg chilled if you are unsure.  I would check the washing question when buying the next dozen."
Am I missing something with rum baba? Why not just make a cake?,"To me, the texture and flavor of a baba are totally distinctive. If they weren’t noteworthy for you, a standard yellow cake will certainly do the job, but I suspect you’ll realize the structure doesn’t hold up in the same way. A good baba is slightly springy and resilient, whereas a soaked cake will just be soft and crumble apart. As for the flavor, I think the yeasty flavor of baba dough is a great complement to the rum syrup, but if you can’t taste it, it’s probably not for you."

Meat Counter employees “smashing” ground meat when they grab from the display case to weigh it,"A little compression wont impact the quality that much, compared to kneading it like dough to work things like egg or spices into the meat.

Rules Post for /r/Askculinary,"Firstly I really love this sub and don’t think there’s much to be improved. One thing I’ve found is that the more popular it gets the more subscribers it attracts (duh) and not all of those people will be experienced cooks. That’s all well and good, we all start somewhere. I do wonder though if there’s room for a system of verified flairs like you see on some of the medical subs? I’ve seen some quite odd answers to questions on here where it seems pretty clear the person answering doesn’t understand food science, is just taking a wild stab at the answer, hasn’t got much cooking experience or all three. I think most people who know what they’re doing can see those answers as being nonsense and in the past they would just be downvoted, but I’m seeing more and more misinformation in top-level answers. I think for the sub to stay credible and continue helping people who need expert guidance that is something that could be looked at."
garlic emulsions- what is the emulsifier in garlic?,"Good question. It turns out there's not a lot of research on this. I only found one piece of literature that talked about emulsifying properties of garlic (link below). It sounds like it's a combination of saponins, fructans, and various proteins that contribute to emulsification. Saponins seem to play the biggest role, as was expected based on previous literature.

Your question about what the emulsifier ""prefers"" is a little misguided since all emulsions by definition need a water and fat component. Adding the water first helps stabilize the emulsion by balancing the water-to-fat ratio. There's water in egg yolks to begin with, but adding too much oil without enough water can also break the emulsion (and vice versa).

Beer in chili at a school function,"A bit of beer in a chili recipe doesn't make it bad for kids. The alcohol will cook off after a few hours, leaving just the flavor. It's not like you're serving up a rum-soaked cake.

What gives pizza dough flavor? Mine is bland,"Time. Yeast raised breads develop their flavour over time, try leaving it in the fridge overnight before using it to give it plenty of time to develop."
[Ingredient Question] Saffron,"Interesting responses and definitely not what I expected. I'm Persian and we use saffron a lot in our cooking. As far as I know, the Spanish use the same method as the Persians, but perhaps some Spaniards can chime in here:

You crush it in a mortar and pestle until you have a powder. Then you pour hot water in the mortar and pestle to allow the saffron to ""bloom"". At that point, you add it to whatever you want.

You could use your fingers to crush the threads but... the color will stain your fingers. It's really difficult to get off. I've also never seen anyone just throw the threads into a dish -- I guess I have, but I made a mental note that they were doing it ""wrong."" edit to add: But that's entirely cultural and not really about right/ wrong. 

On the topic of ""fake"" saffron, Christopher Kimball has a good test for that here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wvEzTh9YpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wvEzTh9YpM) beginning on 4:35."

How much cinnamon is a cinnamon stick?,"Usually a recipe that calls for less than one star of anise will say something like “two blades of star anise”. If it’s not calling for blades, it generally means the whole thing. 

A “one inch stick of cinnamon” means a section of the log that’s an inch long. Nobody sells the logs in one inch lengths, though, so I usually crunch the log with a mug or meat mallet or whatever I have handy, and eyeball what one inch worth of pieces would be.

Is real wasabi in the United States becoming a thing?,"A lot of people overly mystify Japanese food, it’s not that hard!

If you’re in a major city, you can most definitely find an importer that sells Wasabi (it’s no harder to import than any other fresh fruit), and it isn’t hard to grate it either!

There’s a sushi spot I know that sells the real stuff for $1.25 a pop, they grind it fresh. If the demand is there, getting real wasabi isn’t hard.

Why do Asian cuisines tend not to use short noodles?,Long noodles are more practical to eat with chopsticks. Short ones are mainly used in soup
How long can you simmer chicken in a stock and still save the chicken?,"I always pull the meat when it's shreddable and throw the carcass back in. I don't love waste and don't find that breast meat is going to impart that much flavor in stock, so it's worth it to me to take the meat off while it's still enjoyably edible. No sense in eating ashy/chalky chicken. 

When I make stock from bone in chicken I typically season and roast it until cooked through in my dutch oven, then cover it with water and let it cook for maybe 30-45 mins, just until it's falling off the bone, remove the usable meat and return the bones and connective tissue to the broth and cook it until I'm ready for it. Seems to keep a good balance of flavor in the meat and the broth."
What distributors do Indian restaurants in America use?,"I'd imagine it is different everywhere but I can answer for my city. I do live in a large city and there are several different sources for Indian restaurants. First, a lot of products are not that different than regular restaurants. Like the number one produce item used by Indian restaurants is yellow onions and every distributor has those. Most Indian restaurants get the majority of their items from a normal distributor. 

Spices are big in Indian food. We have International markets, farmers markets, Restaruant Depot, a Chef Store who all carry a large amount of Indian spices. Also with any speciality spice distributer they will also have Indian spices. 

There are also speciality distributors that carry nothing but uncommon items, like Gourmet Foods International that will also have a lot of the Indian specific items they use even though the distributor isn't Indian specific. 

In my area I don't know of any distributors that are specifically Indian like we do Asian, Hispanic and even Jamacian, but we do have a lot of importer/exporters. I do know some Indian restaurants go through those to bring in unique items. We also have several Indian grocery stores in my area and many of those import Indian items and can sell them wholesale to their Indian restaurant friends. 

Lastly, a lot of these owners are from India and still have family there. When they go home to visit they bring back items with them or even buy them cheap and ship them back as well. 

There are quite a few options for Indian restaurants. Some use all of these options, some just use a combination."
My mango pie won’t set. 🥺How can I salvage it?,"I would freeze it into popsicles or maybe turn it into parfait by pouring it over chunks of fruit and sponge cake. You could even crumble up the crust and include it. If it hasn’t set by now, it’s probably not going to."
Do I really ever have to peel carrots? Any benefit I’d be missing?,The skin on on older carrots can be tough and a little bitter. But to be honest for every day cooking it's really a manner of preference. As in if people are coming over or particularly old carrots at work. Unless quick cooking or a silky smooth outcome is preferred you really dont have to peel carrots. You dont have to peel most veg. Even squash skin re really yummy crisped up as a chip with oil.

Getting a stainless steel pan hot enough without immediately scorching butter or other ingredients.,"Your pans are *too hot*. Back it down a little bit.

Another thing that people seem to forget with stainless steel pans is that when a protein sticks a little bit, it will typically let go on its own when it's browned and ready to flip.

For eggs... You *can* use stainless, you'll need to use more fat and get the heat exactly right so the whites set against the fat and not against the pan... But it will limit the ways you can cook the egg and be more challenging. I always advocate for keeping a nonstick pan around for certain things, eggs being one of them."
Why do recipes that use coffee call for instant coffee and can I use regular coffee instead?,"It's because the recipe wants to add a coffee flavor without adding liquid and without leaving behind big gritty grounds you have to pick out of your teeth later.

"When you infuse olive oil with dried ingredients, such as dried chilies, how long does the oil last and does it need to be refrigerated?",">from the nets  


 

**How to store infused oil**

All oil will turn rancid eventually but highly flavoured and cold-pressed oils will go off more quickly than refined oils. Light and heat will quicken this process, so don’t keep bottles in sunlight or near the stove. A cool, dark spot (not the fridge) is best and, if in doubt, do taste the oil before you start to cook with it – you’ll know if it’s rancid. As a rule, oils should be used within three months of opening.

"I am considering culinary school, however I have no sense of smell, literally, I lost it in an accident. Will I be able to be successful?","Look up Chris Kearse's story (chef in Philly). He lost his sense of smell in an accident at age 16 but went on to cook at places like French Laundry, Alinea, and some other heavy hitters. Now he's running a really successful restaurant (Forsythia), where I had probably the best meal I ate in 2019."
My kid aspires to be a Chef,"There are a lot of people who would discourage becoming a career chef. It’s incredibly hard work for very little payoff. Encourage him to get a job at a local restaurant. He’ll start as a dishwasher and learn from the bottom up. Kitchens can be a pretty scary place wth a lot of degeneracy, but it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that that’s what the industry is like. Those things will be present or at the least, in the peripherals of his entire career. 

If he still decides that he wants to pursue it as a career, then experience and technique is king. Focus on knife skills. Speed an execution during service. Develop a palate. He might consider a cheap culinary school, but learning on the job in a good restaurant with passionate and talented chefs is a hundred times better. If you have some sort of certification in your country, like Red Seal, encourage him to pursue that, because it’ll likely mean a bump in his salary or wages wherever he works."
Cleaning question: What do you do about food bits and gross water inside a sheet pan's rolled edge?,[deleted]

"My ghee went bad, but started to smell like the most delicious cheese... did I not remove enough solids when I made it?","You probably didn't cook it long enough. The presence of water in your ghee will give rise to the growth of mold, which is why it smells like cheese.

I've been making two pounds of ghee every two weeks for almost thirty years, and there's an art to it that you will learn with experience. I have burnt ghee, and that is so painful you are not likely to make that mistake twice. 

I let the butter cook long and slow. The solids get very brown (but not burnt), and the bubbling noise that occurs in the early stages of cooking is almost completely silent by the end. The noise ghee makes while cooking is due to water. 

Maybe 5 minutes before I know it will be done, I turn off the heat and let it continue cooking under its own heat. Then I ladle it through a clean white handkerchief into a clean, dry jar.

I make about two pounds at a time because we go through it quickly (it's virtually the only cooking fat I use), but if you use it more slowly, you can keep it in the fridge during the summer, and take it out several hours before you need it. Ghee is clear when hot, but as it cools it becomes opaque. My ghee is always a beautiful, deep golden color, because the browning of the ghee solids is what gives the color and extra flavor to ghee. Good luck!  


EDITED to add: I don't  deep-fry any more, but ghee is amazing for that. Back when I did deep fry, I would re-use the ghee a maximum of four times. When I had a bunch of old ghee accumulated, I washed it and made soap out of (mixed with olive pomace oil). The resulting soap looked and smelled faintly of parmesan cheese, but it was a great soap! Twenty years later, I still have a bunch of it left. The cheese smell disappeared when washing, and eventually faded away altogether from the remaining slab of soap..

Can I make fluffy gravy with a whipped cream charger?,"A coworker and I used to ISI everything we could think of. I can't remember our exact results with gravy but given our experiences I think it would most likely thicken and lighten it a bit, turn it more into a spoonable sauce with some body to it. Certainly won't get fluffy enough to stand like whipped cream unless you added some sort of agent to it (tartar? Lecithin? Carrageenan? Xanthan gum? Something like that, it's been a while lol)

Also depends on how you make your gravy, how much water is in it. It's a fine line between fluffy and carbonated when using the ISI. I imagine it would work best with a white gravy."
How do I get fresh thyme to be less of a pain in the butt?,I find that the stem at the very tip tends to be tender enough to to eat. I set aside the tips to give them a rough chop to break them down to a similar size of the leaves if I don't want to chop everything up.

Maple syrup is a Spring food. So why do we associate it so closely with autumn and winter?,"I'm betting is because it was stored for consumption during* the leaner months. When winter comes around in the north woods, easy-to-consume high-calorie foods are really valuable. You can't really forage for much and you need to burn a lot of calories to stay warm. Plus, when the syrup runs, it's still fucking cold out.

What is the functional difference between baking something in a hot oven vs. preheating with the food inside? Do any recipes call for this?,"There are lots of reasons, it's not just a waste of energy. Two off the top of my head:

* every oven heats at a different rate, so there would be no consistency. You'd need to know what kind of oven every recipe was made on and then adjust for yours

* if you don't have good airflow, some areas of the oven may be 50° F or more different than other areas. After preheating all the interior oven parts, the heat distribution will be more even"
Just hired at fancy restaurant; need advice,"Learn how to work quietly. Like I never thought about how important closing drawers and cooler doors lightly helps the equipment, as well as the things inside (an absentminded lowboy door slamming shut can shake your sauce out of a container and spill around your lowboy over the rest of your mis en place).  And same with ovens, pots/pans, station mis en place, plates.... Basically if you're not supposed to make noise and are, you're increasing the risk of breaking or fucking something up.

Also, work from one container to another, with a trash container. Like, one bowl for mushrooms, one for trimming and discards, and one to place product in. Keep your cutting board clean except the current focus.

Fold your towels, stay clean. A folded towel is cleaner, more effective, takes up less room, etc.  And keep your station as clean and organized as you can. And line sweeps show a chef you don't want to lean when you don't have something to do, as well as you care about the cleanliness of his kitchen.


Sharpen your knives, and get nice ones. Show pride in what you're doing and what you use to do it. If someone has a dull ass Mercer or Shun that's been beaten to hell, I can assume they won't be caring much for whatever tasks those knives will be put to. NOTE this does not necessarily translate to knives make you better. I have indeed seen good knife work from terrible knives. So that's why I say sharpen your knives before you get a nice new set of Inox or Masamotos. Splurge after you learn to sharpen and maintain knives.

Start reading cookbooks. Good ones, not Jaime Oliver's best 100 Fuck Ups or whatever. Phaidon is a fantastic publisher, with restaurants like Osteria Francescana and NoMa in their collection. But also, like just badass books about ingredients and tastes and butchering and yea. You'll learn to enjoy going through a cookbook and dissecting their creative processes and cooking methods. I suggest getting a copy of The French Laundry to begin with. Or Momofuku. Both are great starter books. The Fat Duck Cookbook is a much more advanced volume but it is oh so sweet. And maybe one day you can get a copy of elBulli or Modernist Cuisine when you've fallen in love with reading.


Stage around. If you don't know what staging (stah-j / stah -jing) is, it's basically a tryout or short intern at a restaurant traditionally used as an interview, but also as a way to get around some kitchens. It's a great way to spend a day off for workaholics like 90% of our industry. And a lot of restaurants will honor your time in their kitchen with a few dishes to taste their menu. And you get a feel for other kitchens, chefs, teams, cuisines, etc. AND you can network, set up more stages at better restaurants, set up future jobs and relationships within the industry.

Lastly, listen to everyone. That guy that's in the weeds every night and looks like a mess? Maybe what he tells you has some weight because he knows how he's messing up. Some of the best coaches were mediocre or even laughable players. A lot of the time everyone has sage wisdoms to share. When I train new cooks I usually try to help them beyond myself, so they start off as high off the ground as possible. If someone is giving you shit or calling you out, it's because they want to push you to be better. Take it in stride and be better, don't get offended. "
Can I make a cornstarch slurry ahead of time and store it in a squeeze bottle?,"Yes, you just gotta shake it every time prior to using it.

Also, are you perhaps adding too much?  If my hummus tastes too tahini (which is actually a flavor I really like) - I simply add more of the other ingredients to balance it out.

Edit: Also, what liquid are you adding? Traditionally we add chick pea water - which changes the taste versus just water."

* All vegetarian products are fine, unless alcoholic or, y'know, weed. I can't imagine any muslim being concerned about nutmeg unless it's actually in hallucinogenic quantities. 

An ingredient list would be greatly appreciated and taken as considerate.

The only thing you'd want to watch for would be something like vanilla extract, which often contains alcohol. A lot wouldn't care, but it's technically in violation.

ETA: there's no preparation rules, either - you can't make halal ingredients non-halal, except by cross contamination. Deeply, deeply observant types might care about food from a non-halal kitchen or equipment - but for the vast majority, so long as things have been washed since they last had non-halal food on them, it's not an issue."
Aimed towards chefs for clothing advice rather than food advice,Dude get a chill towel or cool towel. I live in the desert and most kitchens are lucky to have a mini split that can keep it under 85 in there. I got one for working Coachella a few years back and it legit saved me. It’ll keep your neck and core temp down and can be run under cold water or frozen for a few minutes. That and a good pair of breathable underwear is all I can recommend
why is there so much oil in carrot cake?,"Carrot cake isn't just a cake with carrots added - it's a different baked good all together. It needs added fat for both moisture and for the consistency we expect. Carrots can add moisture, and that's part of it, but the rich and dense cake we're expecting requires additional fat."
Chicken salt,"I’m reading this thread and am incredibly excited to make chicken salt this weekend, something I was unaware of until 4 minutes ago but am pretty sure is my favorite thing."
Is there any benefit to sauteing rice in olive oil and/or butter before boiling it?,"It just depends on the dish.   

For risotto, it’s essential and you don’t rinse the rice, the starch on the rice keeps it together and you keep a nose on it for the nutty change in smell before adding broth.  For Persian rice you rinse and add butter to steam after parboiling.  For sushi rice you don’t add any oil ingredients at all and rinse thoroughly, the rice will stick by itself and the vinegar and sugar helps.   For pilaf, a sauté with butter/oil keeps it from sticking together."

Cod will not defrost,Call a physicist. This is Nobel prize worthy. Buy softer cod with the prize money
Does cooking meat with acids cause the meat to toughen?,"Acids do actually break down the collagen and connective tissues that can make meat tough but mostly only on the surface of the meat as most marinades and cooking liquids don't really penetrate the meat much

Tenderness is really more related to temperature and cook time than anything related to sauces or seasoning

But if you are marinading meat in something acidic it will eventually start to get mushy if you leave it sitting for too long

But mushy and tender are different things and no one really wants mushy meats"
How to avoid dry chicken on the grill?,"If your chicken is dry, it's overcooked, simple as that.

First, carryover cooking is a thing. The chicken will retain heat and keep cooking, about 5-10 degrees after you pull it. So, if you're pulling at 165, you're going to be overcooked since 165 is already borderline dried out as is with a chicken breast.

Secondly, 165 is the temperature you need to hit to instantly kill effectively all bacteria. Killing bacteria is a function of time and temp, though, so you don't actually need to hit insta-kill temperature. If you cook the chicken to 150 and keep it there or above for 3 minutes (remember, carryover cooking will cook it for another few minutes alone), you achieve the exact same amount of bacteria killing goodness as going to 165 for an instant."
How should I store my cilantro so that it doesn’t go bad so quick?,My solution is usually to just keep making and eating more tacos until it's all gone.

Why should wash rice in a bowl of water and not in a sieve under a faucet?,"I mean, why dirty a sieve when you can just wash the rice in the rice cooker bowl?"
"Can I make gravy for mashed potatoes with just onions, carrots, onions, butter and olive oil?",Yes. If you don’t have flour or cornstarch to thicken the gravy you can try other methods. I’ve puréed the veggies after cooking them and stirred them back into the gravy. You can try bread slices if you have that. Or even stir some mash potatoes into it. It’ll have a little different consistency but it’ll do.
When do I add fresh herbs?,"It depends on what you want from your herbs.  If you add them at the end you get that bright fresh herb flavor.  If you add them during the cooking process you'll destroy a lot of the volatile compounds, but you'll get a nice lingering savory herb flavor.  It won't be as bright and sharp, but it will linger longer and be deeper."
"Why do we (occasionally) see fresh chickpeas, fresh fava beans, but never fresh lentils?",Lentils are already pretty dry by the time they’re harvested.  Growers will check for a rattling sound of the seeds inside the seed pod when they shake the plant.  That means it’s ready.

"Whats the name of that salmon which is not raw but also not cooked i think, its pink and tastes salty","If it tastes smokey, it's Lox/Smoked Salmon.

If it doesn't taste smokey, it's Gravlax.

Gravlax is step 1 of making Lox.

EDIT: Looked into it after some comments: 

According to wikipedia, both Gravlax and Lox are *always* cured and *can be smoked or not* afterwards.

My family & that circle have never used Lox to refer to unsmoked salmon, but that may be a regional thing or a generational thing (or both).

Either way, a bit of fun etymology:

Lox and Lax both come from the Germanic Laks, which means Salmon.

Gravlax comes from Graved Lax which literally means 'Buried Salmon' or 'Grave Salmon'. Salmon was often buried during the curing process."

Do I need to use pre cooked chicken for my panini press?,"Edit: wow! Thanks for the support! 

I remember when I first moved out on my own and started cooking for myself, I wanted to make chicken nachos. So I diced up raw chicken, threw it on top of the nachos and put them in the oven. It never occured to me that I should cook the chicken first. I ended up with tortilla chips burnt to a crisp and raw chicken. I ended up really loving cooking and actually decided to go to chef school instead of continuing on with University. I'm sharing this anecdote because you're bound to get some snarky responses (I can see you've already got at least one) by people who forget that people have to start somewhere, there are no bad questions and it's awesome that you're trying to strech yourself. 
But, yes, you must cook the chicken first."
Uh..how is it safe to use eggs in homemade mayo if we don't cook it? wont the eggs be still raw?,"Raw eggs are not inherently unsafe. 

All food safety regulation is simply about mitigating risk. Because honestly, nothing we eat is without risk of some kind.

Eggs can be infected by salmonella in one of two ways: First, bacteria can be passed from an infected hen to her eggs as they develop inside her. Chickens can be vaccinated against this to mitigate that type of risk. Second, it can grow on the outside of the shell after an egg is laid if it comes in contact with a hen’s poop that contains salmonella.

In the US, the USDA requires eggs sold for consumption to be washed, processed, and then refrigerated. Washing them ensures that any salmonella that was present on the outside of the shells is removed. But- there's a trade off. Washing eggs removes the thin, filmy, protective outer layer called the cuticle. This cuticle is the natural shield that keeps bacteria out of an egg while letting oxygen circulate. 

On the other hand, most European and Asian countries do the opposite and require that table eggs not be wet-washed, and also not refrigerated, because they still have their protective cuticle. Its thus recommended that non-washed eggs be washed immediately before consumption to remove any trace amounts of poop.

Both regulations were arrived at as effective ways to solve the same problem: reducing exposure to salmonella, a bacteria that causes unpleasant, though non-life-threatening, illness.  

Additionally, cooking isn't the only way to ensure food safety. Other ingredients like acid and salt in things like mayo and salad dressings help to create an environment that is less friendly to bacteria growth.

In the US, the CDC estimates Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year and that *most people recover without specific treatment.* Infants, adults aged 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.

Most establishments will note on their menus any items that contain raw eggs so that people can make their own decisions whether or not to consume them."
How do you make smooth Mac N Cheese?,"I have been using sodium citrate to make creamy sauces out of all kinds of cheese. I bought a bag on Amazon and since it only takes a pinch to emulsify the cheese, it has lasted me over a year. If you do a web search on “sodium citrate cheese sauce” you will find lots of videos and blog posts about how it works."
Cabbage and bacon turned out fishy,"Trimethylamine (TMA) is the compound responsible for the 'fishy smell'. Fish have high concentrations of the precursor, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), and they release an enzyme upon cell death that converts it into TMA.

Many vegetables, including cabbage, also contain high concentrations of TMAO which in the presence of a catalyst (such as the enzymes from your salmon) and heat (cooking) will convert into TMA and produce a mind-boggling fishy smell.

It's a very good idea to separate your fish from the rest of your ingredients for this reason.

Some leafy vegetables, including cabbage and spinach, can produce TMA on their own under alkaline conditions. [source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2012.02897.x)

>Fishy off‐flavor in foods is associated with trimethylamine (TMA), which is frequently found in fish and seafood. In this study, TMA was identified for the first time in some leafy vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, and lettuce, at alkaline pH. The presence of TMA in leafy vegetables under certain circumstances such as high pH and temperature may affect the sensory properties of foods containing these vegetables.

Should you ever tire of transmuting vegetables into fish in the future, consider lowering the pH level when cooking them (add some lemon juice).

edit:

I would like to point out in the linked source that they only needed lower the pH level to 7 (neutral) in order to completely eliminate the formation of TMA in spinach, cabbage and lettuce; there's entirely no need to make your veggies taste sour."
"Watching Rick Stein’s India recently, I noticed that everyone from street cooks to top chefs were using these very long, very thin and viciously sharp knives. Tried searching for them but don’t know what they are called. Any ideas?","They're called *bled* or *baleda* and that just means *blade* -- they are very cheap, very disposable, and often made from ANY scrap metal available and there are professional knife sharpeners who ride around on a bike with a pedal grinding stone who will sharpen the street vendors bleds until there's practically nothing left. You can buy replacements from him or from just about any stall or shop that trades in metals. They're not fancy or unique or specialized. They're just cheap and effective."
Anyone ever noticed how like 99% of hand-crank pasta machines are identical?,It's typical for a lot of low-end consumer goods.  It's a lot cheaper to buy a product already in production in bulk from factories in China via Alibaba and slap your name on it than it is to have a custom assembly line set up for a unique product.
"Do professional chefs use timers when cooking, or do they rely on their judgement?","It just depends on what's being cooked.

What happened to my garlic?,In my experience this happens after garlic is harvested but then stored at too high a temperature. Often a rookie mistake in an effort try dry the garlic for storage. I lost most of a crop this way.
Is there anything wrong with marinading my chicken in lemon juice for 2-3 days?,"Yeah, it's going to turn to mush. 

You can get more lemon flavor by using fresh lemon zest. After it's done grilling, toss the chicken in a mixture of lemon zest, a small amount of lemon juice (like 1-2 tablespoons), and salt."
What is the salt used at steakhouses?,"Almost all restaurants use Maldon salt as a finishing salt. They’re larger triangular shaped flakes that add a little crunch and sodium. You only season the outside of the steak, not the inside bits, when cooking, the finishing salt adds that extra flavour. Season with kosher salt though, it has better overall coverage. Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt is what every restaurant I’ve ever worked in uses."

Dicing an onion,"The ""cross sectional"" cut, where you cut with your knife parallel to your cutting board, is unnecessary, imo. If you notice, nature already divides onions up into neat little layers.

However, if you like to do it, make it your first cut and apply firm pressure to the top of the onion with the heel of your palm while your cut. You also want to kind of swipe your knife, back to front, across the onion versus just trying cut straight back. It's just that you are cutting at an awkward angle across the grain of the onion."

Why do some breads get moister when left out?,"Sugar is hygroscopic- which means it absorbs moisture from the air. High sugar breads like banana bread will continue to absorb moisture. 

Low sugar, high starch breads on the other hand under go staling.  Basically, the migration of moisture from starch ends up with recrystalisation which is why old bread go cronch."

Heavy-duty garlic press that can pulverize multiple cloves at once?,"I have the Oxo goodgrips one. It's not big enough for more cloves in one go but it's chunky and coarse enough to just punch though clove after clove, with minimal peeling."
"Can anyone tell me what ingredient is creating this ""honeycomb"" texture in taro fried dumplings (Wu Gok)","OP your observations are pretty on point. Taro should be as starchy/""sandy"" as possible.  Starchy taros are usually lighter since they have lower water content. The center of a taro usually have lower water content than its ends. (Wu Gok/芋角 are from Southern China, traditionally it's claimed that the taros from Lipu, China (荔芋) make the best Wu Gok)

Wheat starch. It's starch with little to no gluten and also the starch used in many other dim sums like the shrimp dumplings (Har Gao)  to provide strength and allow the Wu Gok to hold itself and puff

Temperature of oil depends on which oil you choose, traditionally people use lard. But it's true that it won't honeycomb if the temperature is too high. To check your oil temperature you can always fry a small piece of wrapper first and see the results.  If the temperature is too low, the Wu Gok won't hold itself.

Egg helps, but it's not necessary and not used in typical Wu Gok recipes.

The slang term people in dim sum industry used if your Wu Gok won't honeycomb is ""炸死"", literally means ""fried to death"". Some cheap-ass dim sum place don't even have Taro in Wu Gok, and it's common to add ammonia bicarbonate to help leavening."
Made fresh Almond milk...and it spoilt within 12 hours,"If you aren't going to pasteurize it with some method then you need to sterilize all of the equipment and containers you are going to use. A small amount of salt will help give it a longer life too. You could also soak your almonds in water you bring to a boil first for less time, which would help eliminate any bacterial contaminants. In general any almond milk you make at home is going to have a shelf life of only a few days unless you pasteurize it."
"Ideas for other elements of a MINT-based pesto (instead of basil). E.g. what kind of nuts, oil, cheese... Or other ingredients","I like to make a Thai mint pesto. Instead of lemon I use lime. Instead of parmesan I use fish sauce for salt. Fresh ginger instead of garlic, and peanuts replace pine nuts. Add some serrano chili!"
Why does smoked Haddock get dyed yellow? And do other meats get dyed as well?,"Real smoked haddock, as in cold smoked over wood in a smokehut turns yellowy brown by itself. Chemically treated 'smoked' haddock, has no colour to it, the dye is added to try to make it appear more like the 'real' thing."
What’s the best way to reheat Chinese takeout like crispy sweet and sour pork?,"Oven. Give it about five to ten minutes at 450. Sometimes, I'll even turn the oven to 500. You can regain some of the original texture by doing it this way."
Is leaving the electric stove top burners on a good idea?,"No this is a horrible and unsafe idea.  Heat radiates and can catch stuff around it on fire.  Not to mention someone can accidentally touch it.  When they're on low, you can't tell sometimes with electric.  Especially the old one with coils."
Chicken noodle soup: noodles cooked in water or stock,"Yes you definitely get more flavor boiling the noodles in the soup instead of water.

I, personally, don't find it to be that much a difference. I prioritize having the noodles properly cooked. I hate mushy pasta. Especially if you're talking a big batch to keep for months."
Is raw green cabbage spicy/ hot,"Similarly to your situation, dragonfruit did this to me and I assumed because it was called ""Dragon""fruit that it was supposed to burn or be spicy. I just thought I didn't like it. I asked my daughter how she could drink those dragonfruit drinks and asked her if they were spicy to her. She looked at me like an alien. 

I probably read the same post as you did which made me realize I'm allergic. 

A strange sidenote: I knew someone allergic to popcorn once. Not corn, only popcorn. Food allergies are weird."
Can I just add sugar to a pie dough recipe to make it work for a dessert pie? (It’s originally for a chicken pot pie),"I've always used the same base dough for savoury and sweet pies, but my sweet pies get an extra step before baking.

What separates good sushi from great sushi?,"There are a few things that I'm aware of. One is that even with the same fish, it's not necessarily just cut up and put on rice. It can be aged in various ways, seasoned, or otherwise prepared differently, so there's more room for innovation than you suggest, even in the relatively simple nigiri format.

Additionally, the rice itself makes a huge difference, not only from the quality of the raw rice, but from how it's cooked and seasoned --- it's about half of the food, after all."
"Anyone here knowledgeable on “Cremas” of different types? My local grocer has 5 types of Crema - Guatemalan, Honduran, Salvadorean, Mexican, and just Central American. Pic in post.","They're all pretty similar especially the ones from Central America vs The ones from mexico. 

The central American ones are a bit more yellow in color and have a little bit more of a rich/nutty flavor. Whereas the Mexican ones are more white and taste a bit more like sour cream. I'm Mexican so even though I am biased pretty much the general consensus is that Salvadoran Crema is the best. I love it."
I want to fry the solid cake of rice that forms when I let the rice in my rice cooker cool down in a skillet. Is there a name for such a dish?,"Not soy sauce, but Persian rice, called Tahdig. Cooked in a pot with a crisp crust on the bottom and then flipped so it becomes the top."

Is cooking wine a sin against humanity or what?,"I would say it’s fine. Just like mirin and shaoxing cooking wine are totally acceptable used and are also basically highly salted wines. Like that other guy said, avoid it if your recipe calls for 2 cups of it but it’s totally fine to do a bit here or there. I’m in the same situation and instead of wine, I’ve had good results just using broth vinegar and sugar together in place of wine. You could even use something cool like a fruit based vinegar (I have some fancy raspberry vinegar) to add some interesting complexity."
Is it a bad idea to stab Chicken Strips to cook faster in a deep fryer?,"Your GF is wrong, her manager is correct.  Natural juices are now leaving the chicken and oil is taking it's place."
"Starting a street food business, wondering how I can wash dishes?","If you are serving the public, you will need to check with your local health department to get a temporary food permit or equivalent license allowing you to serve food to the public.  It will come with an inspection: they can provide info on adequate cleaning/sanitizing procedures to keep your set up food-safe. The last thing you want is a foodborne illness outbreak as a result of your stand.

To answer your question,  most food trucks and stands in my area (US, Midwest) are required to have a commissary where they can stock up on supplies, get fresh water, dispose waste,, wash equipment, and prep food in a health-compliant facility.  The facility is also inspected regularly by the health department.

Cast iron,My guess is you are not letting pan get back to heat after 1st batch before putting next patties in. Since pan is not hot the 2nd patty doesn’t sear and doesn’t release when you flip it leaving the 2nd patty’s crust stuck to pan.

Is there any reason to peel butternut squash?,Cutting (and peeling) the squash in small chunk helps the cooking speed.
Is homemade butter worth it?,"It's really fun, but doesn't taste vastly different from store-bought. I once went to a class where we made butter and mixed edible flowers into it. Really beautiful end result, and everyone was amazed to see the butter come together. Plus, churning is a lot easier with a group to take turns. So, TL;DR: fun group activity, but as the book says, [Make the Bread, Buy the Butter](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Bread-Buy-Butter-Shouldnt-ebook/dp/B004T4KXMS)

Edit: FYI I was using a small hand churner attached to a mason jar. Very interested to try using an electric mixer, and making compound and cultured butters!"
Is there anything stopping me from adding cinnamon when I’m creaming my butter and sugar for cookies?,"Try it out. I certainly don't think it would make it worse, but I'm not sure if it would amplify the flavor by a noticeable amount.

If you really want more of a cinnamon taste, you could try blooming the cinnamon in a small amount of butter in a pan, then scraping that directly into the butter and sugar while it's creaming. Just melt a little butter and cook the cinnamon in it for 15-30 seconds."

Why isn't the Michelin Guide Open about their Criteria?,[deleted]
Cooking for someone who can’t taste well after a stroke; I need super strong flavors and spices. NO Salt,"First, because it is low hanging fruit, challenge the salt ban.  IIRC only 1 in 5 hypertensive folks are salt sensitive.  30 years ago when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure I got the full ""no salt"" lectures, including things like ""avoid celery; it is the highest sodium vegetable"".  I did a little research and met again with the nutritionist.  We did a series of tests over a month which demonstrated that unless I lived on beef jerky, ketchup, and dill pickles, sodium had no effect on my blood pressure.  The sodium myth has caused a lot of misery.  This [older article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/) is a pretty accessible introduction to the issue.  He will need to work with his doc and allied health professionals determine if he is in fact one of the minority who are salt sensitive, because if he is, it really matters.

That said ""taste"" is 2 things for most folks: flavors and basic tastes.  Flavors are things like basil and vanilla that we perceive as much through smell as through tongue contact.  Basic tastes are tongue centered: sweet, sour, bitter, spicy hot, salty and maybe umami (depending on who you ask).  Nerve damage from a stroke could affect either smell or tongue or both.  If he can taste sweet and spicy, but is getting no joy from the Mrs Dash stuff, I am guessing it is his nose tasting part that is at issue.  

Pending resolution of the salt impact issue, go for sweet, hot, bitter, sour and umami flavors to build his meals.  Keep in mind that visual cues affect our eating perceptions and that texture gives a great deal of pleasure even though it is not a flavor.  A spicy hot chili of your preferred style, with a quick pickle (sweet sour) coleslaw and a bitter chocolate mousse should be an enjoyable meal for him, if I am understanding your issue correctly.  Good foods to try for bitterness would be eggplant, bell peppers, most dark leafy stuff, grapefruit, asparagus. dark chocolate and coffee.  Spicy hot is pretty obvious as is sweet.  Sour is almost as much so, but buttermilk and other sour dairies might not occur to you right off the bat. Seafoods run toward umami flavors as do mushrooms, walnuts and sweet potatoes; a lot of the umami stuff is also heavily salted, so I will not list it until you sort out whether he is sodium sensitive.

I would start by using the basic tastes and building menus from there.  I would also encourage his nerves to relearn how to perceive the smelled tastes by periodically offering a small amount of his past favorite dishes that rely primarily on flavors.  If he always loved oatmeal raisin cookies, make them.  The texture will be familiar and may help him reconnect to cinnamon and cloves (apple pie would work for this too).  Start with the earliest food memories you can work with, which tend to be sweet taste related.  Do not go too fast, maybe a nose flavor experience twice a week, heavy on the repeat of one flavor for several tries, but with subtly so he does not get depressed or anxious about whether he can taste basil.

Other than the link on sodium sensitivity in hypertension, I haven't given you much documentation; I probably could give you more if you would like it and cannot google it easily.  However my real source is being 61 and having managed the care of a lot of aging family members and parishioners as well as doing companion work in hospice for several years.  I assume and pray that your father is years away from death, but active dying gives one a lot of immediate and intense hands on experience for slow process of simple aging.  Please feel free to ask me to clarify or document anything.  I am usually on-line in the evenings, though tomorrow night I am catering, so it will be spotty for me."

It’s a Punjabi dish, and is native to the subcontinent. Punjabi food is what most of us know outside of India as “Indian food” and was a way of using leftover tandoori chicken until it took off on its own. 

Punjabi food is typically spicy, and relies on thick well seasoned curries, and has some amazing mutton dishes. That said, it’s not all spicy. 

Indian cooking is several dozen unique and regional kitchens, not one overarching idea, and it’s rather reductionist to say 1.8B people all eat the same (much in the same way Americans think 1.8B Chinese people all eat “Chinese food” which is Americanized Cantonese cuisine). So in short, tell your danish friends to remember that all cuisines are modified as they migrate globally. Any diaspora has always modified their food to take advantage of the local agriculture and palette."
"Why does hummus sometimes taste ""stingy"" on my tongue?",You’re allergic to something in it
"When an a recipe calls for an alcoholic ingredient for its flavor (i.e. vodka or wine), how do you know when the alcohol has been cooked off?",I can tell when it cooks off by smelling the steam.
My fried rice never comes out right,"The rice should be loose before adding to the pan and not sticking together that needs to be chopped. Oily means you added to much oil and chewy means you didn’t cook the rice correctly. 

Chopping doesn’t add wok hei, it’s when aerolized fats hit a flame. One main tip is when adding the soy sauce, aim it around the pan so it can sizzle and reduce. People have linked kenji’s serious eats recipe, but check out his YouTube fried rice. He does it all different methods, from a crazy outdoor wokburner to a gas stove to electric."
"Is there a way to give burgers, chicken, etc a charcoal taste when cooking on a stove top?","Get your hands on wood smoked salt, not always available everywhere but you should be able to find it online, use instead of regular salt and bam you got that wood smokie flavour on a stove top. Or you can get your hands on a small smoke generator/vaporizer and pre smoke your meat in a sealed container and grill it on stove top afterwards"
Why does tomato sauce splatter everywhere no matter how low the heat is?,[deleted]
Vegetarian and Vegan Culinary Resources,"(part 1) Hey! I bake and cook a lot of vegan stuff. I generally just Google things to find out what I can use instead, but here is a rough guide to subbing ingredients, and other tips on vegan cooking.

First and foremost, I'd like to say that there are few vegan ingredients that can entirely replace animal ingredients in cooking, especially with ingredients where you rely on the chemical properties as opposed to the flavour. Hence, there are different suggestions for different cooking/baking scenarios.

Also, this guide will be exclusively for vegan cooking.

# EGGS

Eggs are important in non vegan cooking since they provide stabilising proteins and tasty tasty fat, and are also a versatile standalone ingredient. Often they are used to give stability to cakes and cookies, or thicken sauces. Unfortunately, there are very few vegan substitutes that can play the role of an egg in every dish that they are put in. For example, tofu used for scramble won't be suitable in a cake. There are several egg replacements that can be used for different purposes:

* Tofu. This is often used for scramble, flavoured with black salt, but it can work in pad Thai or Singapore noodles too.
* Flaxseed. Commonly used in baking as a binding agent.
* Boxed egg replacements, such as Orgran or Bob's Red Mill varieties. Used as binding agents in baking or very rarely in meringues.
* [Aquafaba](http://aquafaba.com/faq.html). Leftover juice of cooked legumes, used to make Royal icing and meringue.
* Applesauce. Often used alongside flaxseed jn baking to provide moisture.
* Agar. Used to replace eggs when doing a clarification for consommé, or to make faux boiled eggs. A surprisingly useful ingredient for vegan chefs.
* Black salt. Used for sulphurous flavour of eggs.

These are all the egg replacements I can think of. There are obviously more but these are the ones I have commonly used in my cooking.

# DAIRY

This is a very vague category, so I will do. my best to split it up into sections.

[The Non-Dairy Evolution Cookbook by Skye Michael Conroy](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Dairy-Evolution-Cookbook-Modernist-Plant-Based/dp/1499590423/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547506923&sr=8-1&keywords=non+dairy+evolution+cookbook) is an excellent resource on veganising dairy products. I will refer to it as the NDE in this section.

# MILK

Milk is another versatile ingredient. It is used either as a beverage or ingredient, and often in the latter, recipes rely on the chemistry of milk. Cow's milk is mainly made of sugars, water, and protein. Plant milk replacements may vary in what they are made of, but the nutritional content of various plant milks can be found [here](https://1y2u3hx8yml32svgcf0087imj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UACF-Milk-Varieties-Chart.jpg) (image credits to myfitnesspal).

For things that rely on the caramelisation of milk sugars, you should use plant milks that are high in sugar. And so is the case for milks that are high in fat, etc.

Generally, I will use oat, soy, or cashew milk for most applications. To me, they are the creamiest varieties of plant milk and those 3 tend to cover all bases for my culinary applications. Coconut milk is also very good in desserts and Asian savoury dishes.

You can make your own vegan milks but the results are much less consistent when using them as ingredients than buying the milk from the shop. Oat milk is tricky to use as a cooking ingredient for example because it becomes slimy when heated.

# CHEESE

Cheese is a controversial subject in the vegan or nearly-vegan community. Again, with cheese, lots of the things we love about the dairy variety rely on the chemistry of cheese. The stretchiness and coagulation come from casein, a structural protein found in cheese. The sharpness and flavours come from microorganisms eating the sugars in the milk. The browning when cheese is baked is due to the maillard reaction from the proteins and sugars in the cheese.

So you will want to emulate those properties using various ingredients in your cheese. Some of the properties can be found easily in store bought products, for example vegan Parmesan is usually satisfactory for its purpose.

Pizza is something I missed when I went vegan. You can make decent vegan mozzarella using [this recipe](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/melty-stretchy-gooey-vegan-mozarella/), or there is a recipe listed in the NDE that is suitable. On that note, the NDE has plenty of recipes that make delicious vegan cheese. 

# YOGURT

Yogurt can usually be used in the same way as dairy yogurt. Many commercial varieties now exist and have a similar tangy flavour to dairy yogurt. If you're into fermentation, you can make your own; there is a recipe to do so in the NDE or [here](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/yogurt/how-to-make-non-dairy-yogurt/). You can still use vegan yogurt to add moisture to cakes and breads!

# CREAM

Cream can usually be bought in the shops, yet lots of people decide to [make their own out of cashews](https://www.rebootwithjoe.com/savory-or-sweet-cashew-cream/), which is tasty. The shop bought cream is usually single soya cream, so it is suitable for using in cooking but not as whipping cream, since it has a low fat content. To make vegan whipped cream I follow [this](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/09/dairy-free-food-whipping-whipped-cream) recipe. Be cautious that some shop-bought soya cream may have added sugar, which might not be suitable for the application you want to use it for.

# BUTTER

Of all these ingredients, vegan butter is the one I cherish the most. I live in the UK, and I'm loyal to the brands Vitalite and Stork. Butter is incredibly important in both cooking and baking, because it has some wonderful flavour compounds and is responsible in aiding the lovely maillard reaction that gives us delicious browning on our food. 

When using vegan butter, you must be cautious that some margarine often has a higher water content than butter, which we don't necessarily want all the time. You can tell if this is the case by checking the calorie content, or the fat content. My vitalite has 500\~ calories and 50g fat per 100g, whereas my stork baking block has 600\~ calories and about 75g fat per 100g. Butter generally has about 700 calories and 81g fat content. 

Margarines with a higher water content can be useful for creating cakes that are less stodgy and glazing vegetables without using too much fat, however they should be avoided when baking pastries and cookies/biscuits. High fat margarines are preferred for the tastiest pastries since a lot of the properties we love about pastry come from the fat content of pastry.

Another important aspect to consider about vegan butter is the flavour of the butter itself. I like to use vitalite if I want the butter flavour to really shine through, hence why I use it in savoury applications such as glazing vegetables. If your margarine tastes of nothing, your food will be a little lacklustre.

Explain like i'm 5: What is Worcestershire sauce and HP sauce?,"Worcestershire sauce is a garum made from fermented anchovies and spices. Similar to a soy sauce except it’s fermented fish providing the umami rather than fermented legumes. It’s usually used similar to soy sauce cooked into a dish rather than as a condiment added after cooking (but can be!)

HP sauce is essentially a condiment like ketchup but instead of being made from a tomato base it’s base is tomato and tamarind plus vinegar and sugar and spices. HP is much mor flavourful than ketchup but can be used in a similar manner."
"How does one get spherical, super thin, crispy shells around pieces of banana like in the attached photo?",Everybody here is wrong. It’s literally just tempura batter. Look up banana tempura.
I've never washed rice before cooking in the past. I tried it once and can't tell the difference. Why do people care about the starch?,"To quote my father, who has been in the Agriculture industry for a LONG time, “If you saw the inside of a rice mill, you’d wash your rice, too.” "
Help me! What is the closest substitute to garlic that doesn't involve any garlic.,"I believe Elephant Garlic is not actually garlic, but in the leek family. This might be your best bet.

Also, please don't forget that this stuff is super easy to grow in your own garden.

Good luck!"
"Substituting vinegar for citrus: would you keep the quantities the same? Is lemon juice similar in acidity to apple cider vinegar, or do vinegars vary too much in their acidity to standardize this substitution?","In terms of Ph, lemon juice and vinegar are pretty similar, however, that doesn't mean they are perceived the same on the palate.

Vinegar is a fermented product and mostly acetic acid. It hits the palate in a completely different way. Commercially produced vinegar also doesn't have a lot of additional flavor. I'm talking about the stuff in the gallon jug from the grocery store, not the $12 bottle of balsamic finishing vinegar.

By comparison, lemon juice and citrus is is a natural fruit juice, and mostly citric and ascorbic acid. Different acids hit the palate differently. Think about how the acid from a green apple (malic) is different from citrus or vinegar. 

Another consideration is, if the citrus is juiced in a way that expresses a lot of oil from the rind, like with a press, there is a lot of additional flavor added to the juice. Lime juice specifically can have a lot of vanilla flavors. This is the main caution I would give for substituting one for another. Verjus is probably the closest bridge between the two, but it's not as readily accessible and usually overpriced. 

Would you substitute lime juice in a guacamole for cider vinegar? Why or why not? Would you put lemon juice on french fries as a substitute for malt vinegar?"
Can I make a butter-flour roux in a seperate pan and add it to a soup to thicken?,"Absolutely. You can also skip cooking a roux and add Beurre manié, which is just equal parts of flour and butter mixed together. Typical method for thickening soups."
Simple question for those that work in the food industry: how is it that I can order mashed potatoes from a favorite half fancy restaurant and they are always perfectly prepared ready to go?,You're not using enough butter.
Why can duck be cooked medium-rare?,"Ducks are not as aggressively farmed as chickens are, so the incidence of salmonella and other problems is lower.  However, it can still happen and it is a risk.

You can make prosciutto out of duck instead of turkey or chicken as it is a red meat.

Chicken is generally overcooked, particularly in north america, as it's better to be safe than sorry.  Chicken can be cooked to medium or even rare (though I wouldn't recommend that due to the texture) if you are careful enough with the temperatures - sous vide helps there.  But in general, chicken that is cooked to medium with a sous vide only can be a lot more succulent and tasty, it's worth a go."
My duck breast is tough and chewy. What am I doing wrong?,"If you bought them both from the same supplier, get a dick breast from somewhere else and see if it happens again. Breast meat is wing muscle - on a wild shot dick that flies all it's life, they can be tough dry meat that sometimes you wouldn't want to pan fry. I'm not saying yours were wild! But the meat is going to depend a lot on breed and husbandry, and changing suppliers means if you have the same problem, it's down to you :)"
what's the name of the wet-looking chewy white dough-like balls that i was served alongside schnitzel on octoberfest?,"Potato dumplings! They're ""KartoffelKlöße"" you can buy ready made kits at Edeka or make them yourself"
Cinnamon buns in slow cooker were kind of terrible,"Honestly, using a slow cooker. 

Cinnamon buns are a baked food that’s normally cooked in a dry, relatively-high heat environment. By using a slow cooker, you’re cooking them in a wet, relatively low-heat environment instead. The dough is just going to react differently."
Accidentally used cilantro instead of parsley,Do some searching for lamb cilantro recipes. You will find that Cilantro is a pretty common marinade for lamb so...happy accident.
Can I use white unsalted butter instead of yellow unsalted butter in a cake mix ?,"Color of the butter isn't related to the fat content. It's related to the cow's diet. White means it's low in beta-carotene. Yellow means it's high in beta-carotene.

Beta-carotene comes from some grasses and flowers, or beta-carotene rich pasture. During summer, the butter tends to be more yellow as the cows are pasturing. During winter, it tends to be more white as the cows are fed grain.

Depending on where you are in the world, you'll find brands adding food colouring to achieve the yellow color, as their cows never goes out to pasture at any point of the year."
I soaked my black beans overnight but tossed them into my chili without cooking them. Is my chili ruined?,Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.
Baking question: Stollen recipe calls for 5-6 packets of active dry yeast... is this normal?,"I just looked at the recipe an (Austrian) bakery I worked at uses and it calls for 120g fresh yeast for 1000g of flour. Which is about 40g of active dry or indeed 5-6 packets of 7g. That amount makes 6 regular sized Stollen.

This was a very traditional bakery, so it seems like the amount of yeast is indeed pretty traditional.

The issue I think is that Stollen is both a low hydration and high fat dough. This combination means that it needs a lot of yeast to rise properly. There is more butter than eggs and milk combined in the dough!"
Welcome post & Rules Discussion,Potentially unpopular opinion: I think this subreddit is well moderated and I don't think you guys should back off from most of the current rules. Relaxing moderation policies IMO tends to result in lower quality posts and a lower quality subreddit.
"I want to make a penne pasta bake. Should I mix uncooked pasta with the sauce and bake, or should I parboil it first?","I usually partially cook my pasta before using for a pasta bake. Hope it works out well for you and happy cooking adventures with your new oven!

EDIT I bake mine at 180c for about 20mins or until the cheese is all melty and bubbly"
How does pasta made with all purpose flour differ from making it with pasta flour?,"It depends on what kind of pasta you're making. Fresh pasta, like ravioli pasta or tagliatelle, works just fine with AP flour. Dried pastas made with AP flour tend to turn gummy when cooked due to the hydration of the starch, coming out more like dumplings in consistency than pasta. Extruded pastas like macaroni and spaghetti (which you can't even make at home without special equipment) really must be made with semolina flour. Dough made with softer flour won't even work in the extruder. It'll just squish.

If the only flours you have on hand are cake flour, AP flour and bread flour, use bread flour. If all you have is AP, use that to make fresh pasta, but be VERY careful about overcooking it. Just seconds too long in the water and it'll basically melt."
"Alright chefs and line cooks, what's the best way to clean up a massive spill of fryer oil.","I'd always use salt yeah. Flour doughs up, and usually takes longer than the oil to get up clean.
Also you may have heaps of it handily in large sacks if you use it for glass or dish wash machines."
Can you help me compile a list of noob mistakes that people make when cooking at home?,"Number 1 Mistake: Attempting to follow a new recipe WITHOUT first reading it all the way through and WITHOUT getting everything you need at hand, pre-chopped, pre-measured, brought to room temp, marinated, preheated, timed right to serve at the mealtime, etc etc."
"Anyone ever heard of this Italian dish? Degolini - Garlic, beans, breadcrumbs, tomatoes...","The word you are looking for is **tegoline**, which is a word of Venetian origin for green beans.

Your recipe is called [tegołine in tecia](https://blog.giallozafferano.it/buonappetitobypaola/tegoline-in-tecia-fagiolini-stufati/) (green beans in a pot, literally)."
“browning” ground beef,"This is a great question.  More often than not, when we brown ground beef, we throw the chunk in the pan, and cook it until it's not pink.

Essentially this is steaming the meat, as there's so much water being cooked out, and doesn't really make use of the maillard reaction.


For me, if I'm cooking the beef, I'll get the pan hot with some olive oil, and put the meat on it like a burger, and let it brown.  Flip it to the other side, and give that a sear and then chop it up to remove the pink.

But if I want to boost flavor, and have the time, I'll break up the meat into little clusters, almost like tiny burgers, and cook in batches.


So brown the meat can mean both, just depends on what you want."
"I made a very concentrated, somewhat bitter cherry butter. Will it burn/turn more bitter in the oven?","Also: if you put it under the skin, drizzle veg oil over yer bird and that'll help keep what's under the oil from burning. Jacques Pepin."
Would ground ribeye make good burger meat or should it be a little leaner?,"[Here is a recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/274366/black-and-blue-steak-burger/) from ya boy chef john that uses a ribeye to make burgers. Not everyone may agree with your choices, but that's just you cookin. You are after all the right guy to choose the fate of your ribeye."
What's the best way to make spicy honey?,"That's one way to do it, but I find that heating honey causes the flavor of the honey to change.  One way to get around this is to extract the flavor and capsaicin from chilies first. The best way to do this is with a solvent like alcohol (i.e. vodka). Then you can boil the alcohol off and stir the remaining extract into the honey."
"Apples with food grade wax on them ""for freshness""","1 part white vinegar to 3 parts water and soak for 5-10 minutes; make sure to rinse well after. My husband is allergic to that wax coating and this is how we get it off. 

Edit: berries will soak up the liquid so don’t let them soak too long or the flavor will be affected."
Where do I go from where I am to begin my training as a chef.,"Get a job at a not chain restaurant. You have experience already which in restaurants is gold so you should be able to get in just about anywhere - especially if you are somebody who shows up everyday and on time. Listen to the chef and ask questions. That training is going to be worth more than a culinary certificate and you’ll get paid instead of the other way around. If you are keen, you’ll move up and get a reputation that will follow you."
